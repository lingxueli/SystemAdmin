NAME
       hier - description of the filesystem hierarchy

DESCRIPTION
       A typical Linux system has, among others, the following directories:

       /      This is the root directory.  This is where the whole tree starts.

       /boot  Contains static files for the boot loader.  This directory holds only  the  files  which  are
              needed during the boot process.  The map installer and configuration files should go to /sbin
              and /etc.  The operating system kernel (initrd for example) must be located in  either  /  or
              /boot.
