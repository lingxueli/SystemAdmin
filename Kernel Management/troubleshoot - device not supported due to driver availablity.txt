Issue: A device is not fully supported because its kernel module is not loaded

How to identify this issue

List all devices connected to pci bus along with the kernel modules that handles them

# A PCI device is any piece of computer hardware that plugs directly into a PCI slot on a computer's motherboard. PCI, which stands for Peripheral Component Interconnect, was introduced to personal computers by the Intel Corporation in 1993.
# Peripheral Component Interconnect is a local computer bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer and is part of the PCI Local Bus standard.



lspci(8)                                     The PCI Utilities                                     lspci(8)

NAME
       lspci - list all PCI devices

SYNOPSIS
       lspci [options]

DESCRIPTION
       lspci is a utility for displaying information about PCI buses in the system and devices connected to
       them.

   Display options
       -k     Show kernel drivers handling each device and also kernel  modules  capable  of  handling  it.
              Turned on by default when -v is given in the normal mode of output.  (Currently works only on
              Linux with kernel 2.6 or newer.)

   Simple format (-m)
       In  the  simple  format, each device is described on a single line, which is formatted as parameters
       suitable for passing to a shell script, i.e., values separated by whitespaces, quoted and escaped if
       necessary.   Some  of the arguments are positional: slot, class, vendor name, device name, subsystem
       vendor name and subsystem name (the last two are empty if the device has no subsystem); the  remain‐
       ing arguments are option-like:

       -rrev  Revision number.

       -pprogif
              Programming interface.
              
   Verbose format (-vmm)
       The  verbose output is a sequence of records separated by blank lines.  Each record describes a sin‐
       gle device by a sequence of lines, each line containing a single `tag: value' pair. The tag and  the
       value  are  separated  by a single tab character.  Neither the records nor the lines within a record
       are in any particular order.  Tags are case-sensitive.

       The following tags are defined:

       Slot   The name of the slot where the device resides ([domain:]bus:device.function).   This  tag  is
              always the first in a record.

       Class  Name of the class.

       Vendor Name of the vendor.

       Device Name of the device.

       SVendor
              Name of the subsystem vendor (optional).

       SDevice
              Name of the subsystem (optional).

       PhySlot
              The physical slot where the device resides (optional, Linux only).

       Rev    Revision number (optional).

       ProgIf Programming interface (optional).

       Driver Kernel driver currently handling the device (optional, Linux only).

       Module Kernel  module  reporting  that  it is capable of handling the device (optional, Linux only).
              Multiple lines with this tag can occur.

       NUMANode
              NUMA node this device is connected to (optional, Linux only).

       New tags can be added in future versions, so you should silently ignore any tags  you  don't  recog‐
       nize.

# if there's no modules support the device, you may consider the closed source kernel module.
# It might endanger system stability.

# A better preventative approach would be to confirm with the vendor that Linux is fully supported, before you purchase the hardware.
