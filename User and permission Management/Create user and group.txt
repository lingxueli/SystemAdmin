Create users edwin and santos and make them members of the group sales as
a secondary group membership. Also, create users serene and alex and make
them members of the group account as a secondary group

To define a user, the information is included in these two files:
/etc/passwd
/ect/shadow

To create a user, use the following command:

$ useradd -m -G sales edwin 
$ useradd -m -G sales santos
$ useradd -m -G account alex
$ useradd -m -G account serene
# -m: create home directory
# -G: define secondary group


[root@localhost /]# useradd -m -G sales edwin
useradd: group 'sales' does not exist

Group are defined in file: /etc/group

To create a group, use the following:

$ groupadd sales
$ groupadd account


[root@localhost ~]# man -k user
useradd (8)          - create a new user or update default new user information
userdel (8)          - delete a user account and related files
usermod (8)          - modify a user account

[root@localhost ~]# man useradd

       -G, --groups GROUP1[,GROUP2,...[,GROUPN]]]
           A list of supplementary groups which the user is also a member of. Each group is
           separated from the next by a comma, with no intervening whitespace. The groups are
           subject to the same restrictions as the group given with the -g option. The default is
           for the user to belong only to the initial group.
       -m, --create-home
           Create the user's home directory if it does not exist. The files and directories
           contained in the skeleton directory (which can be defined with the -k option) will be
           copied to the home directory.

           By default, if this option is not specified and CREATE_HOME is not enabled, no home
           directories are created.

           The directory where the user's home directory is created must exist and have proper
           SELinux context and permissions. Otherwise the user's home directory cannot be created
           or accessed.

       -u, --uid UID
           The numerical value of the user's ID. This value must be unique, unless the -o option
           is used. The value must be non-negative. The default is to use the smallest ID value
           greater than or equal to UID_MIN and greater than every other user.

           See also the -r option and the UID_MAX description.
