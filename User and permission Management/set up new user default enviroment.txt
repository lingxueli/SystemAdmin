# To change the default setting of new user, make the change under skeleton folder
cd /etc/skel

# add default folders to home directory
mkdir /Pictures

# modify default editor
# .bashrc : settting for the subshell when the current user starts one 
vim .bashrc

# Add variables to the bottom
export EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim


Why the default EDITOR setting is in .bashrc not .bash_profile?
Because .bash_profile settings only works in log in shell.

When a user issue a command such as visudo, the user enters a subshell, and it inherites settings from .bashrc only.

The default editor works when you issue the Visudo, and it's the setting of a subshell that's taking effect.


Where's the variable EDITOR coming from?

1. printenv command – Print all or part of environment.
2. env command – Display all exported environment or run a program in a modified environment.
3. set command – List the name and value of each shell variable.


The printenv and env commands print only the environment variables. If you want to get a list of all variables, including environment, shell and variables, and shell functions you can use the set command.

$ man bash
