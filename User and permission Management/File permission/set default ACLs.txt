Default ACLs applys to new files/subdirectories in the current structure.
Update normal ACLs changes the existing files/subdirectories.

If you want the ACL rule applies to the whole structure, please update normal ACLs and default ACL.

NAME
       setfacl - set file access control lists

SYNOPSIS
       setfacl [-bkndRLPvh] [{-m|-x} acl_spec] [{-M|-X} acl_file] file ...

       -d, --default
           All  operations apply to the Default ACL. Regular ACL entries in the input set are pro‐
           moted to Default ACL entries. Default ACL entries in the input set  are  discarded.  (A
           warning is issued if that happens).

       -k, --remove-default
           Remove the Default ACL. If no Default ACL exists, no warnings are issued.

   ACL ENTRIES
       The  setfacl  utility recognizes the following ACL entry formats (blanks inserted for clar‐
       ity):

       [d[efault]:] [u[ser]:]uid [:perms]
              Permissions of a named user. Permissions of the file owner if uid is empty.

       [d[efault]:] g[roup]:gid [:perms]
              Permissions of a named group. Permissions of the owning group if gid is empty.

       [d[efault]:] m[ask][:] [:perms]
              Effective rights mask

       [d[efault]:] o[ther][:] [:perms]
              Permissions of others.


set default ACL
[root@localhost ~]# setfacl -m d:g:sysadmins:r-x ACLdir

set defaul permission of others

normal ACL setting on others doesn't do anything more than chmod -o.
However default ACL setting on others could do more than chmod.

# this sets the default ACL of others
# any new files under ACLdir would not gain any access
# this cannot be accomplished by chmod at once.

[root@localhost ~]# setfacl -m d:o::- ACLdir
