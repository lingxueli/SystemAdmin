              Enable Extended User Attributes.  See the attr(5) manual page.

       acl    Enable POSIX Access Control Lists.  See the acl(5) manual page.

NAME
       xattr - Extended attributes

DESCRIPTION
       Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated permanently with files and directories, similar to
       the environment strings associated with a process.  An attribute may be defined or undefined.   If  it
       is defined, its value may be empty or non-empty.

       Extended  attributes  are  extensions to the normal attributes which are associated with all inodes in
       the system (i.e., the stat(2) data).  They are often used to provide  additional  functionality  to  a
       filesystem—for example, additional security features such as Access Control Lists (ACLs) may be imple‐
       mented using extended attributes.

       Users with search access to a file or directory may use listxattr(2) to retrieve a list  of  attribute
       names defined for that file or directory.

NAME
       chattr - change file attributes on a Linux file system

SYNOPSIS
       chattr [ -RVf ] [ -v version ] [ -p project ] [ mode ] files...

DESCRIPTION
       chattr changes the file attributes on a Linux file system.

       The format of a symbolic mode is +-=[aAcCdDeFijPsStTu].

       The  operator  '+' causes the selected attributes to be added to the existing attributes of the files;
       '-' causes them to be removed; and '=' causes them to be the only attributes that the files have.

ATTRIBUTES
       a      A file with the 'a' attribute set can only be opened in append  mode  for  writing.   Only  the
              superuser  or  a  process  possessing  the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can set or clear this
              attribute.
