NAME
       newgrp - log in to a new group

SYNOPSIS
       newgrp [-] [group]

DESCRIPTION
       The newgrp command is used to change the current group ID during a
       login session. If the optional - flag is given, the user's environment
       will be reinitialized as though the user had logged in, otherwise the
       current environment, including current working directory, remains
       unchanged.

[lisa@localhost ~]$ man 1p newgrp

NAME
       newgrp — change to a new group

SYNOPSIS

       newgrp [−l] [group]

DESCRIPTION
       The newgrp utility shall create a new shell execution environment  with
       a new real and effective group identification. Of the attributes listed
       in Section 2.12, Shell Execution Environment, the new  shell  execution
       environment shall retain the working directory, file creation mask, and
       exported variables from the previous environment (that is, open  files,
       traps,  unexported  variables,  alias definitions, shell functions, and
       set options may be lost). All other aspects of the process  environment
       that  are preserved by the exec family of functions defined in the Sys‐
       tem Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2008 shall also be preserved  by  new‐
       grp; whether other aspects are preserved is unspecified.

OPERANDS
       The following operand shall be supported:

       group     A group name  from  the  group  database  or  a  non-negative
                 numeric  group  ID.  Specifies the group ID to which the real
                 and effective group IDs shall be set. If group is a non-nega‐
                 tive  numeric  string  and  exists in the group database as a
                 group name (see getgrnam()), the numeric group ID  associated
                 with that group name shall be used as the group ID.
