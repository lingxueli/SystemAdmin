This gives user all the admin priviledges

$ usermod -aG wheel user
$ visudo
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL

This allows user to have specific admin priviledges
$ visudo
linda ALL=/usr/bin/useradd, /usr/bin/passed



USERMOD(8)                System Management Commands                USERMOD(8)

NAME
       usermod - modify a user account

SYNOPSIS
       usermod [options] LOGIN

DESCRIPTION
       The usermod command modifies the system account files to reflect the
       changes that are specified on the command line.
       
OPTIONS
       The options which apply to the usermod command are:

       -a, --append
           Add the user to the supplementary group(s). Use only with the -G
           option.

       -G, --groups GROUP1[,GROUP2,...[,GROUPN]]]
           A list of supplementary groups which the user is also a member of.
           Each group is separated from the next by a comma, with no
           intervening whitespace. The groups are subject to the same
           restrictions as the group given with the -g option.

           If the user is currently a member of a group which is not listed,
           the user will be removed from the group. This behaviour can be
           changed via the -a option, which appends the user to the current
           supplementary group list.
           
           
VISUDO(8)                 BSD System Manager's Manual                VISUDO(8)

NAME
     visudo — edit the sudoers file

SYNOPSIS
     visudo [-chqsV] [[-f] sudoers]

DESCRIPTION
     visudo edits the sudoers file in a safe fashion, analogous to vipw(8).
     visudo locks the sudoers file against multiple simultaneous edits, pro‐
     vides basic sanity checks, and checks for parse errors before installing
     the edited file.  If the sudoers file is currently being edited you will
     receive a message to try again later.


FILES
     /etc/sudo.conf            Sudo front end configuration

     /etc/sudoers              List of who can run what

     /etc/sudoers.tmp          Default temporary file used by visudo

$ visudo
## Sudoers allows particular users to run various commands as
## the root user, without needing the root password.
##
## Examples are provided at the bottom of the file for collections
## of related commands, which can then be delegated out to particular
## users or groups.
##
## This file must be edited with the 'visudo' command.


## Next comes the main part: which users can run what software on
## which machines (the sudoers file can be shared between multiple
## systems).
## Syntax:
##
##      user    MACHINE=COMMANDS
##
## The COMMANDS section may have other options added to it.
##
## Allow root to run any commands anywhere
root    ALL=(ALL)       ALL

## Allows members of the 'sys' group to run networking, software,
## service management apps and more.
# %sys ALL = NETWORKING, SOFTWARE, SERVICES, STORAGE, DELEGATING, PROCESSES, LOCATE, DRIVERS

## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL

## Same thing without a password
# %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

## Allows members of the users group to mount and unmount the
## cdrom as root
# %users  ALL=/sbin/mount /mnt/cdrom, /sbin/umount /mnt/cdrom

## Allows members of the users group to shutdown this system
# %users  localhost=/sbin/shutdown -h now

## Read drop-in files from /etc/sudoers.d (the # here does not mean a comment)
#includedir /etc/sudoers.d
