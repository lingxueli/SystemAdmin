visudo is the tool to edit the sudoer file: /etc/sudoers

visudo locks the sudoers file against multiple simultaneous edits, provides basic sanity checks, and checks for parse errors. If the sudoers file is currently being edited you will receive a message to try again later

[root@localhost /]# visudo
#
# Defaults   env_keep += "HOME"

Defaults    secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
## Sudoers allows particular users to run various commands as
## the root user, without needing the root password.
##
## Examples are provided at the bottom of the file for collections
## of related commands, which can then be delegated out to particular
## users or groups.
##
## This file must be edited with the 'visudo' command.


## Next comes the main part: which users can run what software on
## which machines (the sudoers file can be shared between multiple
## systems).
## Syntax:
##
##      user    MACHINE=COMMANDS
##
## The COMMANDS section may have other options added to it.
##
## Allow root to run any commands anywhere
root    ALL=(ALL)       ALL

## Allows members of the 'sys' group to run networking, software,
## service management apps and more.
# %sys ALL = NETWORKING, SOFTWARE, SERVICES, STORAGE, DELEGATING, PROCESSES, LOCATE, DRIVERS

## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL

## Same thing without a password
# %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

## Allows members of the users group to mount and unmount the
## cdrom as root
# %users  ALL=/sbin/mount /mnt/cdrom, /sbin/umount /mnt/cdrom

## Allows members of the users group to shutdown this system
# %users  localhost=/sbin/shutdown -h now

## Read drop-in files from /etc/sudoers.d (the # here does not mean a comment)
#includedir /etc/sudoers.d


Any change made to /etc/sudoers.d will apply to sudoer privilege.

man sudoers
search(escape .): /sudoer\.d

Including other files from within sudoers
     It is possible to include other sudoers files from within the sudoers file currently being
     parsed using the #include and #includedir directives.

     This can be used, for example, to keep a site-wide sudoers file in addition to a local, per-
     machine file.  For the sake of this example the site-wide sudoers file will be /etc/sudoers
     and the per-machine one will be /etc/sudoers.local.  To include /etc/sudoers.local from
     within /etc/sudoers we would use the following line in /etc/sudoers:

         #include /etc/sudoers.local

     The #includedir directive can be used to create a sudoers.d directory that the system package
     manager can drop sudoers file rules into as part of package installation.  For example,
     given:

         #includedir /etc/sudoers.d

     sudo will suspend processing of the current file and read each file in /etc/sudoers.d, skip‐
     ping file names that end in ‘~’ or contain a ‘.’ character to avoid causing problems with
     package manager or editor temporary/backup files.  Files are parsed in sorted lexical order.
     That is, /etc/sudoers.d/01_first will be parsed before /etc/sudoers.d/10_second.  Be aware
     that because the sorting is lexical, not numeric, /etc/sudoers.d/1_whoops would be loaded
     after /etc/sudoers.d/10_second.  Using a consistent number of leading zeroes in the file
     names can be used to avoid such problems.  After parsing the files in the directory, control
     returns to the file that contained the #includedir directive.



Use visudo -f  command to edit these sudoer files.


Use the syntax from /etc/sudoers to define permission

[root@localhost sudoers.d]# visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/sysadmins
# allow user in group sysadmins to run all commands
%sysadmins  ALL=(ALL)       ALL

# allow user in group sysadmins to run all commands without a password
%sysadmins        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
