Set default values for new users. Make sure that any new user password has
a length of at least six characters and must be used for at least three days
before it can be reset

The default setting of user password is under /etc/login.defs

/etc/login.defs: Please note that the parameters in this configuration file control the
behavior of the tools from the shadow-utils component.

shadow-utils package includes the necessary programs for converting UNIX password files to the shadow password format, plus
programs for managing user and group accounts


To make the change, adjust the following parameters:

# Password aging controls:
#
#       PASS_MAX_DAYS   Maximum number of days a password may be used.
#       PASS_MIN_DAYS   Minimum number of days allowed between password changes.
#       PASS_MIN_LEN    Minimum acceptable password length.
#       PASS_WARN_AGE   Number of days warning given before a password expires.
#
PASS_MAX_DAYS   99999
PASS_MIN_DAYS   0             => 3
PASS_MIN_LEN    5             => 6
PASS_WARN_AGE   7


Set default values for new users. A user should get a warning three days
before expiration of the current password. Also, new passwords should
have a maximum lifetime of 120 days.
