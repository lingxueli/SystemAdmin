       -b, --base-dir BASE_DIR
           The default base directory for the system if -d HOME_DIR is not specified.  BASE_DIR is
           concatenated with the account name to define the home directory. If the -m option is
           not used, BASE_DIR must exist.

           If this option is not specified, useradd will use the base directory specified by the
           HOME variable in /etc/default/useradd, or /home by default.

       -D, --defaults
           See below, the subsection "Changing the default values".

       MOTD_FILE (string)
           If defined, ":" delimited list of "message of the day" files to be displayed upon
           login.

       ENV_PATH (string)
           If set, it will be used to define the PATH environment variable when a regular user
           login. The value is a colon separated list of paths (for example /bin:/usr/bin) and can
           be preceded by PATH=. The default value is PATH=/bin:/usr/bin.

       PASS_MAX_DAYS (number)
           The maximum number of days a password may be used. If the password is older than this,
           a password change will be forced. If not specified, -1 will be assumed (which disables
           the restriction).

       PASS_MIN_DAYS (number)
           The minimum number of days allowed between password changes. Any password changes
           attempted sooner than this will be rejected. If not specified, -1 will be assumed
           (which disables the restriction).

       PASS_WARN_AGE (number)
           The number of days warning given before a password expires. A zero means warning is
           given only upon the day of expiration, a negative value means no warning is given. If
           not specified, no warning will be provided.

       UID_MAX (number), UID_MIN (number)
           Range of user IDs used for the creation of regular users by useradd or newusers.

           The default value for UID_MIN (resp.  UID_MAX) is 1000 (resp. 60000).

       CREATE_HOME (boolean)
           Indicate if a home directory should be created by default for new users.

           This setting does not apply to system users, and can be overridden on the command line.
