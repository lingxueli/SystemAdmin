$ man useradd
USERADD(8)                System Management Commands                USERADD(8)

NAME
       useradd - create a new user or update default new user information

SYNOPSIS
       useradd [options] LOGIN

       useradd -D

       useradd -D [options]

DESCRIPTION
       When invoked without the -D option, the useradd command creates a new
       user account using the values specified on the command line plus the
       default values from the system. Depending on command line options, the
       useradd command will update system files and may also create the new
       user's home directory and copy initial files.

       By default, a group will also be created for the new user (see -g, -N,
       -U, and USERGROUPS_ENAB).


OPTIONS
       The options which apply to the useradd command are:

       -b, --base-dir BASE_DIR
           The default base directory for the system if -d HOME_DIR is not specified.  BASE_DIR is
           concatenated with the account name to define the home directory. If the -m option is
           not used, BASE_DIR must exist.

           If this option is not specified, useradd will use the base directory specified by the
           HOME variable in /etc/default/useradd, or /home by default.

       -D, --defaults
           See below, the subsection "Changing the default values".

   Changing the default values
       When invoked with only the -D option, useradd will display the current
       default values. When invoked with -D plus other options, useradd will
       update the default values for the specified options. Valid
       default-changing options are:

       -b, --base-dir BASE_DIR
           The path prefix for a new user's home directory. The user's name
           will be affixed to the end of BASE_DIR to form the new user's home
           directory name, if the -d option is not used when creating a new
           account.

           This option sets the HOME variable in /etc/default/useradd.

       -e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE
           The date on which the user account is disabled.

           This option sets the EXPIRE variable in /etc/default/useradd.

       -f, --inactive INACTIVE
           The number of days after a password has expired before the account
           will be disabled.

...

CONFIGURATION
       The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change the behavior of this tool:
       ...
FILES

           User account information.

       /etc/shadow
           Secure user account information.

       /etc/default/useradd
           Default values for account creation.

       /etc/skel/
           Directory containing default files.

       /etc/login.defs
           Shadow password suite configuration.

[root@localhost ~]# man 5 login.defs
# more varialbes in /etc/login.defs change the behavior of useradd
       MOTD_FILE (string)
           If defined, ":" delimited list of "message of the day" files to be displayed upon
           login.

       ENV_PATH (string)
           If set, it will be used to define the PATH environment variable when a regular user
           login. The value is a colon separated list of paths (for example /bin:/usr/bin) and can
           be preceded by PATH=. The default value is PATH=/bin:/usr/bin.

       PASS_MAX_DAYS (number)
           The maximum number of days a password may be used. If the password is older than this,
           a password change will be forced. If not specified, -1 will be assumed (which disables
           the restriction).

       PASS_MIN_DAYS (number)
           The minimum number of days allowed between password changes. Any password changes
           attempted sooner than this will be rejected. If not specified, -1 will be assumed
           (which disables the restriction).

       PASS_WARN_AGE (number)
           The number of days warning given before a password expires. A zero means warning is
           given only upon the day of expiration, a negative value means no warning is given. If
           not specified, no warning will be provided.

       UID_MAX (number), UID_MIN (number)
           Range of user IDs used for the creation of regular users by useradd or newusers.

           The default value for UID_MIN (resp.  UID_MAX) is 1000 (resp. 60000).

       CREATE_HOME (boolean)
           Indicate if a home directory should be created by default for new users.

           This setting does not apply to system users, and can be overridden on the command line.

$ man useradd

       -g, --gid GROUP
           The group name or number of the user's initial login group. The
           group name must exist. A group number must refer to an already
           existing group.

           If not specified, the behavior of useradd will depend on the
           USERGROUPS_ENAB variable in /etc/login.defs. If this variable is
           set to yes (or -U/--user-group is specified on the command line), a
           group will be created for the user, with the same name as her
           loginname. If the variable is set to no (or -N/--no-user-group is
           specified on the command line), useradd will set the primary group
           of the new user to the value specified by the GROUP variable in
           /etc/default/useradd, or 100 by default.

       -G, --groups GROUP1[,GROUP2,...[,GROUPN]]]
           A list of supplementary groups which the user is also a member of.
           Each group is separated from the next by a comma, with no
           intervening whitespace. The groups are subject to the same
           restrictions as the group given with the -g option. The default is
           for the user to belong only to the initial group.

       -m, --create-home
           Create the user's home directory if it does not exist. The files
           and directories contained in the skeleton directory (which can be
           defined with the -k option) will be copied to the home directory.

           By default, if this option is not specified and CREATE_HOME is not
           enabled, no home directories are created.

           The directory where the user's home directory is created must exist
           and have proper SELinux context and permissions. Otherwise the
           user's home directory cannot be created or accessed.

       -u, --uid UID
           The numerical value of the user's ID. This value must be unique,
           unless the -o option is used. The value must be non-negative. The
           default is to use the smallest ID value greater than or equal to
           UID_MIN and greater than every other user.

           See also the -r option and the UID_MAX description.


[root@localhost ~]# man -k user | grep delet
userdel (8)          - delete a user account and related files

$ man userdel
       -r, --remove
           Files in the user's home directory will be removed along with the
           home directory itself and the user's mail spool. Files located in
           other file systems will have to be searched for and deleted
           manually.

           The mail spool is defined by the MAIL_DIR variable in the
           login.defs file.



Modify user
$ usermod -aG

[root@localhost ~]# man -k user | grep modify
usermod (8)          - modify a user account

       -a, --append
           Add the user to the supplementary group(s). Use only with the -G
           option.

       -G, --groups GROUP1[,GROUP2,...[,GROUPN]]]
           A list of supplementary groups which the user is also a member of.
           Each group is separated from the next by a comma, with no
           intervening whitespace. The groups are subject to the same
           restrictions as the group given with the -g option.

Skeleton directory /etc/skel
It's the template for new user's home directory

$ man useradd
       /etc/default/useradd

       /etc/skel/
           Directory containing default files.

# Please note that the parameters in this configuration file control the
# behavior of the tools from the shadow-utils component. None of these
# tools uses the PAM mechanism, and the utilities that use PAM (such as the
# passwd command) should therefore be configured elsewhere. Refer to
# /etc/pam.d/system-auth for more information.
