Exampe of SUID(set user ID):

/usr/bin/passwd has SUID set up for normal user to change password.

Because when a user changes his password, it needs root permission to write to /etc/shadow. Only root user can do that.

[root@localhost /]# ls -l /etc/shadow
----------. 1 root root 1472 Jan 23 15:48 /etc/shadow

Normal user gain the root permission through /usr/bin/passwd. because passwd has SUID == 1. User running passwd will take over the same permission as passwd's owner - root. Then this user is able to change the shadow file.

[root@localhost /]# ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 33600 Apr  6  2020 /usr/bin/passwd

In summary, SUID:
    on files - user executes file with permission of the file owner
    on directory - no meaning
    
    

Example of SGID(set group ID):

SGID set on a file has the same effect of an SUID.

SGID set on a directory makes it a shared directory of the group. 

The claimed group becomes the group owner of the directory and also its subdirectories and files under it.

In summary, SGID
    on file - user executes file with permissions of group owner
    on directory - files created in diretory get the same group owner
    
    
Sticky bit:

Sticky bit is used on shared group directory. It prevents users from deleting files from other users.

A user can only delete the file if either of the following is true:

1. user is the owner of the file
2. user is the owner of the directory where the file exists
