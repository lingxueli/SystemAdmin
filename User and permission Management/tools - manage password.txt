              that  her  password  will expire, if the user's account supports password lifetimes.
              Available to root only.

       -n, --minimum DAYS
              This will set the minimum password lifetime, in days, if the user's account supports
              password lifetimes.  Available to root only.
       -x, --maximum DAYS
              This will set the maximum password lifetime, in days, if the user's account supports
              password lifetimes.  Available to root only.



[root@localhost ~]# man chage

       -E, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE
           Set the date or number of days since January 1, 1970 on which the user's account will
           no longer be accessible. The date may also be expressed in the format YYYY-MM-DD (or
           the format more commonly used in your area). A user whose account is locked must
           contact the system administrator before being able to use the system again.

           For example the following can be used to set an account to expire in 180 days:

                        chage -E $(date -d +180days +%Y-%m-%d)

           Passing the number -1 as the EXPIRE_DATE will remove an account expiration date.
       -l, --list
           Show account aging information.

       If none of the options are selected, chage operates in an interactive fashion, prompting
       the user with the current values for all of the fields. Enter the new value to change the
       field, or leave the line blank to use the current value. The current value is displayed
       between a pair of [ ] marks.
