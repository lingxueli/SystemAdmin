You need to look in two files: /etc/groups and /etc/passwd

/etc/groups shows the user's secondary group
/etc/passwd shows the user's primary group

[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/group | grep santos
sales:x:1001:edwin,santos
santos:x:1004:
sysadmins:x:1007:edwin,santos

[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/passwd | grep santos
santos:x:1002:1004::/home/santos:/bin/bash


To find the members that a group has:
[root@localhost ~]# man groupmems

       -g, --group group_name
           The superuser can specify which group membership list to modify.

       -h, --help
           Display help message and exit.

       -l, --list
           List the group membership list.

[root@localhost ~]# groupmems -g sysadmins -l
edwin  santos 

# /etc/group only list users that uses it as a secondary group
[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/group | grep sysadmin
sysadmins:x:1007:edwin,santos
