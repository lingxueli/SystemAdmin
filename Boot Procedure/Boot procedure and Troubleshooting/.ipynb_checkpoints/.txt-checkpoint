Follow the instruction on the bottom of the screen

Boot menu -> option 'e' for edit GRUB command prompt

-> option 'c' for a full GRUB command prompt

Choose 'e', the line for boot argument starts with linxu ($root)/vmlinuz

This changes boot argument temporarily. To change permanently, pls update the grub2 config file and push its change to GRUB script by grub2-mkconfig.

1. boot argument rd.break


it stops the boot procedure while it's still in the initramfs stage
It's used in the process of recovering the root password

2. init=/bin/sh or init=/bin/bash

it starts the shell imediately after loading the kernel and initramfs

3.

systemd.unit=emergency.target
systemd.unit=rescue.target

this starts a different operation mode. 

You can use "systemctl list-units" to see the number of loaded unitds.

It brings you to a shell where you still have access to the command line
