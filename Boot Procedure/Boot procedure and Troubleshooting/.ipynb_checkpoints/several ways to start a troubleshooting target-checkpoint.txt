1. a one-time change of the boot argument

From the boot menu, follow the instruction on the bottom of the screen -> "e" for edit. This will edit how GRUB 2 starts the kernel.

Another option "c" is for a full GRUB command prompt

the line of boot arguments starts with linux ($root)/vmlinuz ...

2. how to make the change of boot argument persistent

Edit the GRUB 2 config file /etc/default/grub, push the change to the GRUB script by "grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg" command
