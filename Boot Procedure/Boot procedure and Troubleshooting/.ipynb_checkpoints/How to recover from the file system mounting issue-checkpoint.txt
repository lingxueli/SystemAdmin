If there's an issue with mounting the file system, you'll see this error msg: "Give root password for maintenance".

It appears when fsck tries to verify the integrity of the file system in /etc/fstab during booting and the integrity check fails. 

The system asks for a manual intervention by showing this error msg.


When this occurs, you should:

1. type root password as suggested

2. use journalctl -xb to see logs as suggested

3. remount the root file system and analyze what's wrong with /etc/fstab and fix it:

$ mount -o remount,rw /
$ vi /etc/fstab


$ man mount

    -o
        options
        
File System independent mount options
    rw
        Mount the file system read-write
    remount
        Attempt to mount an already mounted file system
