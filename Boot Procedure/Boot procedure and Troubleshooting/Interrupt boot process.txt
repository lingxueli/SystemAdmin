Before a boot loader is located, there's a start-up screen passes quickly, showing the system is loading.

Press F2 to enter SETUP
F12 for network boot
ESC for boot menu  -> To use the rescue disk, Press ESC for boot menu

in boot menu you can choose from 
1. removable device
2.hard drive
3.CD-ROM drive  -> To use the rescue disk, Use CD-ROM drive because rescue disk is on the installion disk.
4.network boot from Intel E1000.

If you boot from CD-ROM drive, you can choose from 
1.install Centos linux 8
2.test this media and install
3.troubleshooting.  -> To use the rescue disk, select troubleshooting.


In troubleshooting menu, you can 
1. install Centos linux 8 in basic graphics mode-> try this option if you have issue install linux

2. rescue a Centos linux 8 system -> use this option for the rescue disk. If the system cannot boot, this let you access and edit the config file to try to get it boot again

3. run a memory test  -> use this option to see if the memory is working correctly

4. boot from local drive -> use this option if the boot loader on hard disk does not work. This offers a boot loader on the installation disk

5. return to main menu

From the rescue disk, accept the default read-write mount of Linux installation on /mnt/sysimage
And change the root file system to be /mnt/sysimage. 

$ chroot /mnt/sysimage

Anything not in this file system are read-only. Thus, no configuration change could be made. So you need to change root.


Then you get access to the root file system and you can access all tools that you need to repair the system.


From the rescue disk's root shell, you can

1. reinstall boot loader
2. re-create initramfs


1. reinstall boot loader

$ grub2-install 



Reference:
$ grub2 tab
$ grub2-install help
$ info grub

grub2-install INSTALL_DEVICE

on KVM(Kernel-based Virtual Machine): 
$ grub2-install /dev/vda

on a phsycial server/VMWare/Virutal Box
$ grub2-install /dev/sda

/dev/sdX - SCSI device; Small Computer System Interface is a set of standards for physically connecting and transferring data between computers and peripheral devices. Some examples of SCSI devices are hard drives, CD-ROM drives, tape drives, and scanners.

/dev/sdX is peripheral on your hard disk.

2. re-create initramfs

dracut - If used without arguments, it creates a new initramfs for the kernel currently loaded

Use this command to re-create this:

$ dracut --force
OR 
$ dracut -f
# without force option, it will not overwrite the existing one

# no man page is available in the rescue disk and you're not able to install man-pages

If you boot from hard drive, which is the default:

On the boot loader menu, a few boot loaders are available:

Press 'e' to edit the boot loader

-> this offers an interface with a default GRUB 2 script related to boot loader settings. You can edit the boot argument on top of that.

Press 'c' for a command prompt

-> This offers an interface similar to a "terminal" to edit the boot loader


linux (loop)/isolinux/vmlinuz0 boot=isolinux iso-scan/filename=$isofile root=live:LABEL=$isolabel ro rd.live.image quiet rhgb  
-> linux command - Load a Linux kernel


initrd (loop)/isolinux/initrd0.img  
-> initrd commadn Load a Linux initrd

Reference: GRUB 2 command https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/html_node/Commands.html#Commands

Boot arguments is here:

Linux ($root)/vmlinuz root=....


You can edit the boot argument in the end of this line, such as:

1. Remove 'rhgb' and 'quiet' in the end for debug messages

2. Add rd.break. This stops the boot procedure while still in the initramfs stage. It's used to recover root password.

3. systemd.unit=emergency.target to boot into a minimum operational mode
Or rescue.target into a more complete operational mode

Any change made from here are temporary to GRUB 2 boot loader. Persistent change is made through here: /etc/default/grub and use grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grup2/grub.cfg to push the config to the main config file.
