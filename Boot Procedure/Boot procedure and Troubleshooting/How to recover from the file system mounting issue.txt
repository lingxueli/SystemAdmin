You'll see this error msg: "Give root password for maintenance".

It appears when fsck tries to verify the integrity of the file system in /etc/fstab during booting.

However, fsck check fails.

When this occurs, you should:

1. type root password as suggested

2. use journalctl -xb to see logs as suggested

3. remount the root file system and analyze what's wrong with /etc/fstab:

$ man mount

    -o
        options
        
File System independent mount options
    rw
        Mount the file system read-write
    remount
        Attempt to mount an already mounted file system
        
$ mount -o remount,rw /
