1. Firmware executes POST check on hardware. 
POST = power-on self-test

The firmware can be UEFI(Universal Extended Firmware Interface) or BIOS(Basic Input Output System).
Firmware initializes the hardware.

2. Firmware finds the bootable device and loads the boot loader

From bootable device, a boot loader is located. on RHEL it's GRUB 2.

3. Boot loaders loads kernel and initramfs into memory

At this phase, it's the minimal operating system. On boot menu, you can choose the operating system to load.

initramfs = initial ram disk, also known as initrd

    What does initramfs do?

        initramfs loads kernel modules for hardwares, as well as the initial scripts. 

         - kernel modules for hardwares: it loads udev deamon to take care of the hardware initialization
         - initial scripts: it loads the first process /sbin/init . This process is linked to Systemd.

       /bin/, /sbin/, /usr/sbin/
           These compatibility symlinks point to /usr/bin/, ensuring that scripts and binaries
           referencing these legacy paths correctly find their binaries.

       /usr/
           Vendor-supplied operating system resources. Usually read-only, but this is not
           required. Possibly shared between multiple hosts. This directory should not be modified
           by the administrator, except when installing or removing vendor-supplied packages.

       /usr/bin/
           Binaries and executables for user commands that shall appear in the $PATH search path.
           It is recommended not to place binaries in this directory that are not useful for
           invocation from a shell (such as daemon binaries); these should be placed in a
           subdirectory of /usr/lib/ instead.


    What does kernel do?

        In the minimal operating environment, kernel finds the file system image from /boot, and mount it on the /sysroot directory. This is a temporay root file system.
        Later, the kernel unmounts the initrd image, and mount the actual physical root file system on /.

        After root file system is ready, kernel executes the Systemd process with PID 1 and passes control over to it.

       /boot/
           The boot partition used for bringing up the system. On EFI systems, this is possibly
           the EFI System Partition (ESP), also see systemd-gpt-auto-generator(8). This directory
           is usually strictly local to the host, and should be considered read-only, except when
           a new kernel or boot loader is installed. This directory only exists on systems that
           run on physical or emulated hardware that requires boot loaders.

4. Systemd run the default target

Systemd looks for the default target to execute and runs all of its units. All user space processes and network services are started from here. 

A login screen is presented, user can authenticate. 

Login prompt can be prompted before all systemd unit files have been loaded succesfully. Login prompt != fully operational
