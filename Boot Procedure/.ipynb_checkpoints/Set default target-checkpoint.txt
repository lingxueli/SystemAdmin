   Group Command
       Groups are virtual collections of packages. DNF keeps track  of  groups
       that the user selected ("marked") installed and can manipulate the com‐
       prising packages with simple commands.

       dnf [options] group [summary] <group-spec>
              Display overview of how many groups are installed and available.
              With a spec, limit the output to the matching groups. summary is
              the default groups subcommand.

       dnf [options] group info <group-spec>
              Display package lists of  a  group.  Shows  which  packages  are
              installed or available from a repository when -v is used.

       dnf [options] group install [--with-optional] <group-spec>...
              Mark  the specified group installed and install packages it con‐
              tains.  Also  include  optional  packages  of   the   group   if

       dnf [options] group list <group-spec>...
              List  all  matching  groups, either among installed or available
              groups.  If  nothing  is  specified,  list  all  known   groups.
              --installed  and  --available  options narrow down the requested
              list.  Records are ordered by the display_order tag  defined  in
              comps.xml  file.   Provides a list of all hidden groups by using
