Before a boot loader is located, there's a start-up screen passes quickly, showing the system is loading.

Press F2 to enter SETUP
F12 for network boot
ESC for boot menu


On the boot loader menu, a few boot loaders are available:

Press 'e' to edit the boot loader

-> this offers an interface with a default C script related to boot loader settings. You can edit the boot argument on top of that.

Press 'c' for a command prompt

-> This offers an interface similar to a "terminal" to edit the boot loader


linux (loop)/isolinux/vmlinuz0 boot=isolinux iso-scan/filename=$isofile root=live:LABEL=$isolabel ro rd.live.image quiet rhgb  -> linux command - Load a Linux kernel


initrd (loop)/isolinux/initrd0.img   -> initrd commadn Load a Linux initrd

Reference: GRUB 2 command https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/html_node/Commands.html#Commands

Boot arguments is here:

Linux ($root)/vmlinuz root=....


You can edit the boot argument in the end of this line, such as:

1. Remove 'rhgb' and 'quiet' in the end for debug messages

2. Add rd.break. This stops the boot procedure while still in the initramfs stage. It's used to recover root password.

3. systemd.unit=emergency.target to boot into a minimum operational mode
Or rescue.target into a more complete operational mode

Any change made from here are temporary to GRUB 2 boot loader. Persistent change is made through here: /etc/default/grub and use grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grup2/grub.cfg to push the config to the main config file.
