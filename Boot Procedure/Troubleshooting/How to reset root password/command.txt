How to enter root shell without root password/How to reset root password

1. Enter into edit mode of the boot mene: Press e from GRUB 2 boot menu

2. It returns these commands and variables:

load_video
set gfx_payload=keep
insmod gzio
linux ($root) ...
initrd ($root) ...

This is the user interface of GRUB 2 boot loader, not the boot loader itself or any coding language.

Refer to Section 14, 15 and 16

line 8: linux
linux: Load a Linux kernel image from file. The rest of the line is passed verbatim as the kernel command-line. Any initrd must be reloaded after using this command

line 9: initrd
initrd: Load an initial ramdisk for a Linux kernel image, and set the appropriate parameters in the Linux setup area in memory. This may only be used after the linux command (see linux) has been run

3. Add rd.break to the end of line 8 (i.e. rd.break as a boot parameter), press Ctrl + X to start (i.e. boot with this option)

load_video
set gfx_payload=keep
insmod gzio
linux ($root) ... rd.break
initrd ($root) ...

Adding rd.break to the end of the line with kernel parameters in Grub stops the start up process before the regular root filesystem is mounted (hence the necessity to chroot into sysroot)

With the updated GRUB 2 boot commands(line 23-27), it brings you to the end of the boot stage where initramfs is loaded, just before a mount of the root file system on the directory /sysroot

5. Now it brings you to the shell of the emergency mode 
Emergency mode, on the other hand, does mount the regular root filesystem, but it only mounts it in a read-only mode

6. In emergency mode, remount the root filesystem with read/write access:

$ mount -o remount,rw /sysroot

6. make /sysroot the new root directory:
$ chroot /sysroot
This commands start a new shell where the /sysroot directory will appear as /
chroot:  run command or interactive shell with special root directory

chroot NEWROOT
Run COMMAND with root directory set to NEWROOT.

Now this command get you into the root shell

4. passwd
# set password for root user

5. load_policy -i
# load the SELinux policy

6. chcon -t shadow_t /etc/shadow
# set the correct context type to /etc/shadow, so that other users could log in as before

7. reboot
