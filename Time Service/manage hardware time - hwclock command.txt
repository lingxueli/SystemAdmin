NAME
       hwclock - time clocks utility

SYNOPSIS
       hwclock [function] [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       hwclock  is an administration tool for the time clocks.  It can: display the Hardware Clock
       time; set the Hardware Clock to a specified time; set the Hardware Clock  from  the  System
       Clock;  set  the System Clock from the Hardware Clock; compensate for Hardware Clock drift;
       correct the System Clock timescale; set the kernel's timezone,  NTP  timescale,  and  epoch
       (Alpha only); and predict future Hardware Clock values based on its drift rate.

       -s, --hctosys
              Set the System Clock from the Hardware Clock.  The time read from the Hardware Clock
              is compensated to account for systematic drift before using it  to  set  the  System
              Clock.  See the discussion below, under The Adjust Function.
       -w, --systohc
              Set the Hardware Clock from the System Clock, and update the timestamps in /etc/adj‚Äê
              time.  With the --update-drift option also (re)calculate the drift factor.   Try  it
              without the option if --systohc fails.  See --update-drift below.
