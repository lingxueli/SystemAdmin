If the server is connected to the internet, it's easy to set up the NTP(network time protocol)


1. check if the config file has the time server from the internet pool

https://www.ntppool.org/en/use.html


[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/chrony.conf
# Use public servers from the pool.ntp.org project.
# Please consider joining the pool (http://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html).
# pool 2.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
pool serverabc.example.com iburst

...

By default, chrony service is configured to get the right time form the internet. The highly reliable time servers from pool.ntp.org are used.
In corporate environment, it's not always desirable for time client to go out to the internet. Local time services should be used instead.


2. turn on the ntp service
$ timedatectl set-ntp 1

TIMEDATECTL(1)                              timedatectl                             TIMEDATECTL(1)

NAME
       timedatectl - Control the system time and date

SYNOPSIS
       timedatectl [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND}

DESCRIPTION
       timedatectl may be used to query and change the system clock and its settings.

       Use systemd-firstboot(1) to initialize the system time zone for mounted (but not booted)
       system images.

       timedatectl may be used to show the current status of systemd-timesyncd.service(8).
       
COMMANDS
       The following commands are understood:

       status
           Show current settings of the system clock and RTC, including whether network time
           synchronization through systemd-timesyncd.service is active. Even if it is inactive, a
           different service might still synchronize the clock. If no command is specified, this
           is the implied default.

       set-ntp [BOOL]
           Takes a boolean argument. Controls whether network time synchronization is active and
           enabled (if available). If the argument is true, this enables and starts the first
           existed service listed in the environment variable $SYSTEMD_TIMEDATED_NTP_SERVICES of
           systemd-timedated.service. If the argument is false, then this disables and stops the
           all services listed in $SYSTEMD_TIMEDATED_NTP_SERVICES.
