CHRONYD(8)                             System Administration                            CHRONYD(8)

NAME
       chronyd - chrony daemon

SYNOPSIS
       chronyd [OPTION]... [DIRECTIVE]...

DESCRIPTION
       chronyd is a daemon for synchronisation of the system clock. It can synchronise the clock
       with NTP servers, reference clocks (e.g. a GPS receiver), and manual input using wristwatch
       and keyboard via chronyc. It can also operate as an NTPv4 (RFC 5905) server and peer to
       provide a time service to other computers in the network.

NAME
       chrony.conf - chronyd configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       chrony.conf

DESCRIPTION
       This file configures the chronyd daemon. The compiled-in location is /etc/chrony.conf, but
       other locations can be specified on the chronyd command line with the -f option.

           stratum stratum
               This option sets the stratum of the server which will be reported to clients when
               the local reference is active. The specified value is in the range 1 through 15,
               and the default value is 10. It should be larger than the maximum expected stratum
               in the network when external NTP servers are accessible.

               Stratum 1 indicates a computer that has a true real-time reference directly
               connected to it (e.g. GPS, atomic clock, etc.), such computers are expected to be
               very close to real time. Stratum 2 computers are those which have a stratum 1
               server; stratum 3 computers have a stratum 2 server and so on. A value of 10
               indicates that the clock is so many hops away from a reference clock that its time
               is fairly unreliable.

timedatectl (1)      - Control the system time and date

TIMEDATECTL(1)                              timedatectl                             TIMEDATECTL(1)

NAME
       timedatectl - Control the system time and date

SYNOPSIS
       timedatectl [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND}

DESCRIPTION
       timedatectl may be used to query and change the system clock and its settings.

       Use systemd-firstboot(1) to initialize the system time zone for mounted (but not booted)
       system images.

       timedatectl may be used to show the current status of systemd-timesyncd.service(8).

COMMANDS
       The following commands are understood:

       status
           Show current settings of the system clock and RTC, including whether network time
           synchronization through systemd-timesyncd.service is active. Even if it is inactive, a
           different service might still synchronize the clock. If no command is specified, this
           is the implied default.

       show
           Show the same information as status, but in machine readable form. This command is
           intended to be used whenever computer-parsable output is required. Use status if you
           are looking for formatted human-readable output.

           By default, empty properties are suppressed. Use --all to show those too. To select
           specific properties to show, use --property=.

       set-time [TIME]
           Set the system clock to the specified time. This will also update the RTC time
           accordingly. The time may be specified in the format "2012-10-30 18:17:16".

       set-ntp [BOOL]
           Takes a boolean argument. Controls whether network time synchronization is active and
           enabled (if available). If the argument is true, this enables and starts the first
           existed service listed in the environment variable $SYSTEMD_TIMEDATED_NTP_SERVICES of
           systemd-timedated.service. If the argument is false, then this disables and stops the
           all services listed in $SYSTEMD_TIMEDATED_NTP_SERVICES.

COMMANDS
       The following commands are understood:

       status
           Show current settings of the system clock and RTC, including whether network time
           synchronization through systemd-timesyncd.service is active. Even if it is inactive, a
           different service might still synchronize the clock. If no command is specified, this
           is the implied default.

       set-time [TIME]
           Set the system clock to the specified time. This will also update the RTC time
           accordingly. The time may be specified in the format "2012-10-30 18:17:16".

       set-timezone [TIMEZONE]
           Set the system time zone to the specified value. Available timezones can be listed with
           list-timezones. If the RTC is configured to be in the local time, this will also update
           the RTC time. This call will alter the /etc/localtime symlink. See localtime(5) for
           more information.

       list-timezones
           List available time zones, one per line. Entries from the list can be set as the system
           timezone with set-timezone.

       set-local-rtc [BOOL]                  ### RTC (the real-time clock, i.e. hardware clock)
           Takes a boolean argument. If "0", the system is configured to maintain the RTC in
           universal time. If "1", it will maintain the RTC in local time instead. Note that
           maintaining the RTC in the local timezone is not fully supported and will create
           various problems with time zone changes and daylight saving adjustments. If at all
           possible, keep the RTC in UTC mode. Note that invoking this will also synchronize the
           RTC from the system clock, unless --adjust-system-clock is passed (see above). This
           command will change the 3rd line of /etc/adjtime, as documented in hwclock(8).

       set-ntp [BOOL]
           Takes a boolean argument. Controls whether network time synchronization is active and
           enabled (if available). If the argument is true, this enables and starts the first
           existed service listed in the environment variable $SYSTEMD_TIMEDATED_NTP_SERVICES of
           systemd-timedated.service. If the argument is false, then this disables and stops the
           all services listed in $SYSTEMD_TIMEDATED_NTP_SERVICES.
