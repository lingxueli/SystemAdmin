chrony is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol

after chornyd config is updated, restart the service

$ systemctl restart chronyd


On the NTP server, open the firewalls to allow the ntp services

$ firewall-cmd --add-service ntp --permanent

Load the new firewall rules from permanent to runtime
$ firewall-cmd reload



[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --get-services | grep ntp
RH-Satellite-6 ...ntp nut openvpn ovirt-imageio ...

       [--permanent] --get-services
           Print predefined services as a space separated list.
           
       [--permanent] [--zone=zone] --list-services
           List services added for zone as a space separated list. If zone is omitted, default
           zone will be used.

       [--permanent] [--zone=zone] --add-service=service [--timeout=timeval]
           Add a service for zone. If zone is omitted, default zone will be used. This option can
           be specified multiple times. If a timeout is supplied, the rule will be active for the
           specified amount of time and will be removed automatically afterwards.  timeval is
           either a number (of seconds) or number followed by one of characters s (seconds), m
           (minutes), h (hours), for example 20m or 1h.

           The service is one of the firewalld provided services. To get a list of the supported
           services, use firewall-cmd --get-services.

           The --timeout option is not combinable with the --permanent option.
           
           
       --reload
           Reload firewall rules and keep state information. Current permanent configuration will
           become new runtime configuration, i.e. all runtime only changes done until reload are
           lost with reload if they have not been also in permanent configuration.

           Note: Runtime changes applied via the direct interface are not affected and will
           therefore stay in place until firewalld daemon is restarted completely.
