hostname + dns domain = FQDN

how to change the hostname?

1.nmtui -> select the option change hostname

2.
$ hostnamectl set-hostname myhost.example.com
$ hostnamectl status


hostname (1)         - show or set the system's host name
hostname (5)         - Local hostname configuration file
hostname (7)         - hostname resolution description
hostname_selinux (8) - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the hostname processes
hostnamectl (1)      - Control the system hostname


[root@localhost ~]# hostnamectl s
set-chassis     set-deployment  set-hostname    set-icon-name   set-location    status

$ man hostnamectl
DESCRIPTION
       hostnamectl may be used to query and change the system hostname and related settings.

       This tool distinguishes three different hostnames: the high-level "pretty" hostname which might
       include all kinds of special characters (e.g. "Lennart's Laptop"), the static hostname which is used
       to initialize the kernel hostname at boot (e.g. "lennarts-laptop"), and the transient hostname which
       is a fallback value received from network configuration. If a static hostname is set, and is valid
       (something other than localhost), then the transient hostname is not used.

       Note that the pretty hostname has little restrictions on the characters and length used, while the
       static and transient hostnames are limited to the usually accepted characters of Internet domain
       names, and 64 characters at maximum (the latter being a Linux limitation).

       The static hostname is stored in /etc/hostname, see hostname(5) for more information. The pretty
       hostname, chassis type, and icon name are stored in /etc/machine-info, see machine-info(5).

3.edit /etc/hosts


[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6



[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/hostname
localhost.localdomain

hosts (5)            - static table lookup for hostnames
HOSTS(5)                                  Linux Programmer's Manual                                  HOSTS(5)

NAME
       hosts - static table lookup for hostnames

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/hosts

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  describes the format of the /etc/hosts file.  This file is a simple text file that
       associates IP addresses with hostnames, one line per IP address.  For each host a single  line  should
       be present with the following information:

              IP_address canonical_hostname [aliases...]


       Fields  of  the  entry  are  separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.  Text from a "#"
       character until the end of the line is a comment,  and  is  ignored.   Host  names  may  contain  only
       alphanumeric  characters,  minus  signs  ("-"), and periods (".").  They must begin with an alphabetic
       character and end with an alphanumeric character.  Optional aliases provide for name  changes,  alter‐
       nate spellings, shorter hostnames, or generic hostnames (for example, localhost).

FILES
       /etc/hosts

EXAMPLE
       # The following lines are desirable for IPv4 capable hosts
       127.0.0.1       localhost

       # 127.0.1.1 is often used for the FQDN of the machine
       127.0.1.1       thishost.mydomain.org  thishost
       192.168.1.10    foo.mydomain.org       foo
       192.168.1.13    bar.mydomain.org       bar
       146.82.138.7    master.debian.org      master
       209.237.226.90  www.opensource.org

       # The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
       ::1             localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
       ff02::1         ip6-allnodes
       ff02::2         ip6-allrouters


/etc/hosts - includes ip + hostname, used for translation between ip and hostname
/etc/hostname - includes hostname



definition as set in /etc/hosts has high order than the hostname in dns, by default as defined in /etc/nsswitch.conf

# Note that your changes may not be applied as they may be

# profile takes always precedence and overwrites the same maps
# set in the user file. Only maps that are not set by the profile
# are applied from the user file.
#
# For example, if the profile sets:
#     passwd: sss files
# and /etc/authselect/user-nsswitch.conf contains:
#     passwd: files
#     hosts: files dns
# the resulting generated nsswitch.conf will be:
#     passwd: sss files # from profile
#     hosts: files dns  # from user file
...
# In order of likelihood of use to accelerate lookup.
shadow:     files sss
hosts:      files dns myhostname    => /etc/hosts > dns > myhostname



NSSWITCH.CONF(5)                          Linux Programmer's Manual                          NSSWITCH.CONF(5)

NAME
       nsswitch.conf - Name Service Switch configuration file

DESCRIPTION
       The Name Service Switch (NSS) configuration file, /etc/nsswitch.conf, is used by the GNU C Library and
       certain other applications to determine the sources from which to obtain name-service information in a
       range  of  categories,  and  in  what order.  Each category of information is identified by a database
       name.

       The file is plain ASCII text, with columns separated by spaces or tab characters.   The  first  column
       specifies  the database name.  The remaining columns describe the order of sources to query and a lim‐
       ited set of actions that can be performed by lookup result.

       The following databases are understood by the GNU C Library:

       aliases     Mail aliases, used by getaliasent(3) and related functions.

...
       hosts       Host names and numbers, used by gethostbyname(3) and related functions.
...

       Here is an example /etc/nsswitch.conf file:

           passwd:         compat
           group:          compat
           shadow:         compat

           hosts:          dns [!UNAVAIL=return] files
           networks:       nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
           ethers:         nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
           protocols:      nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
           rpc:            nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
           services:       nis [NOTFOUND=return] files
