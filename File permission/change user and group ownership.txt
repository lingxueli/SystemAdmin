EXAMPLES
       chown root /u
              Change the owner of /u to "root".

       chown root:staff /u
              Likewise, but also change its group to "staff".

       chown -hR root /u
              Change the owner of /u and subfiles to "root".


       -R, --recursive
              operate on files and directories recursively
       -h, --no-dereference
              affect symbolic links instead of any referenced file (useful only  on  systems  that
              can change the ownership of a symlink)

       Owner is unchanged if missing.  Group is unchanged if missing, but changed to  login  group
       if  implied by a ':' following a symbolic OWNER.  OWNER and GROUP may be numeric as well as
       symbolic.

              Change the group of /u to "staff".

       chgrp -hR staff /u
              Change the group of /u and subfiles to "staff".
