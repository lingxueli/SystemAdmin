max - umask = permission

maximum permission of a file: 666
maximum permission of a directory: 777

To change umask for all users:
/etc/profile.d -> umask.sh
It applys to all users after loggin in to the server.

[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/profile
# /etc/profile

# System wide environment and startup programs, for login setup
# Functions and aliases go in /etc/bashrc

# It's NOT a good idea to change this file unless you know what you
# are doing. It's much better to create a custom.sh shell script in
# /etc/profile.d/ to make custom changes to your environment, as this
# will prevent the need for merging in future updates.


To change umask for individual user:
$HOME/.profile
