NAME
       tuned-profiles - description of basic tuned profiles

PROFILES
       At the moment we're providing the following pre-defined profiles:

       balanced
              It is the default profile. It provides balanced power saving and performance.

       powersave
              Maximal power saving, at the moment it enables USB autosuspend (in case environment variable USB_AUTOSUSPEND is set  to  1), enables  ALPM  power  saving for SATA host adapters and sets the link power management policy to min_power.  
              
       throughput-performance
              Profile for typical throughput performance tuning. Disables power saving mechanisms and enables sysctl settings that improve the throughput performance of your disk and network IO. 
              
       accelerator-performance
              This profile contains the same tuning as the throughput-performance profile.  Additionally, it locks the CPU to low C states so that the latency is less than 100us. This improves the performance of certain accelerators, such as GPUs.

tuned.noarch:

Noarch stands for no architecture. Actually, the term noarch means no particular architecture or if you will, all architectures. It references files, such as images, manuals or even applications that are universal across all platforms

Tuned: Daemon for monitoring and adaptive tuning of system devices.

(This is tuned 2.0 with a new code base. If you are looking for the older
version, please check out branch '1.0' in our Git repository.)

How to use it
-------------

In Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and their derivates install tuned package
(optionally tuned-utils, tuned-utils-systemtap, and tuned-profiles-compat):

# yum install tuned

After the installation, start the tuned service:

# systemctl start tuned

You might also want to run tuned whenever your machine starts:

# systemctl enable tuned

If the daemon is running you can easily control it using 'tuned-adm' command
line utility...


# turn on tuned service
[root@localhost /]# yum -y install tuned
[root@localhost /]# systemctl status tuned
