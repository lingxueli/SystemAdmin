Parent and child relations of process

If the shell stops, all the processes are killed, exception is the backgroud process.
The background process becomes the child of systemd, when its parent process is killed.
To kill the background process, use kill command.

In RHEL 8, nohup is no longer needed because background is immune from the interuption.
In the old version, background process is terminated when shell is stopped. We use nohup to protect them from being terminated here.
In the current version, background process is alive when shell is stopped.
