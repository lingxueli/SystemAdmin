Three types of process

1. Shell jobs			interactive processes. Associated with shell where the process was started.
2. Daemon 				non interactive processes. often started when a computer is booted and run with root priviledges.
3. kernal threads 		

part of the linux kernel. they are not managable.You won't be able to kill them unless the entire machine is down.
it's important to monitor them using ps command. They are recongized with a [] around the process name in its output.

Type 2 and 3 are background processes.


Parent and child relations of process

In the earlier version of red hat, all child processes are terminated when the parent process dies, including background processes. 

nohup is needed to prevent this interuption of the background processes.

In RHEL 8, child processes become the child of systemd when its parent process dies, including background processes.

To kill the background process, use kill command.


Adjust niceness/priority

	backup job consumes lots of resources and it needs lower priority
	important calculation job needs higher priority


	Use increment of 5 when adjust the niceness value and watch. Do not use extreme value without observance.
	Niceness range from - 20 to + 19 (see $ man nice)
    
	Only root can increase priority. other uses can only lower the priority.
