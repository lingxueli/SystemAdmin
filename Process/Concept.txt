Parent and child relations of process

	If the shell stops, all the processes are killed, exception is the backgroud process.
	The background process becomes the child of systemd, when its parent process is killed.
	To kill the background process, use kill command.

	In RHEL 8, nohup is no longer needed because background is immune from the interuption.
	In the old version, background process is terminated when shell is stopped. We use nohup to protect them from being terminated here.
	In the current version, background process is alive when shell is stopped.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Process management

	System admin manage process, not the thread. It's up to app developers to manage the thread.

	Two types of background process are: kernel threads and daemon process.
	Kernal threads is part of the linux kernel. It's not manageable. You won't be able to kill them unless the entire machine is down.
	Kernal threads has [] around name from ps aux

Adjust niceness/priority

	backup job needs lower priority
	important calculation job needs higher priority

	It's no risk for kernel process getting blocked because: 
	1. Morden system differentiate the kernel process from user process.
	2. multiple core CPU.

	Use increment of 5 when adjust the niceness value and watch. Do not use extreme value without observance.
	Niceness range from - ? to + ? Priority ranges from ? -20 to 19

	Only root can increase priority other uses cannot.
