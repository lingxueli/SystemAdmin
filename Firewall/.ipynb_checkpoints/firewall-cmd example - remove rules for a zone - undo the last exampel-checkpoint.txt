Current default zone is internal

1. undo the public zone new rules

[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --remove-service http --zone public --permanent
success


2. undo the internal zone new rules


[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --remove-port 5901-5910/tcp --permanent
success

[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
success

[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --list-ports

# internal zone config change is made to the permanent(static) and runtime


3. switch zone and activate the previous rules

Switch zone by change the default zone.
Further update will be applied to the new default zone.

Because only default zone accepts changes to the runtime rules.

If you want to activate the new rules to a non-default zone, you need to set it as a default zone.

Because non-default zone accept changes to the permanent rules only. If change needs to be made to the runtime, you need to push it to the runtime by
firewall-cmd --reload
This command works on the default zone only. You need to set it as the default zone in order to make the change happen.


[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --set-default-zone public
success
[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
public

# activate
[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
success

# confirm
[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --list-service
