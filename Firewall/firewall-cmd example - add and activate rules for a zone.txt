Add services, add ports, and manage zones

1. add firewalld http servcie to the zone

[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --get-default-zone 
public

# add http service to the public zone
# it copies the default zone config into the customized config and add the new rule

[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
success


# update firewalld rules in runtime
# permanent config (static) is pushed to the runtime

[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
success

# test to confirm the activation of the new rule

[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --list-services 
cockpit dhcpv6-client http ssh vnc-server

# verify config
[root@localhost ~]# cat /usr/lib/firewalld/zones/public.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<zone>
  <short>Public</short>
  <description>For use in public areas. You do not trust the other computers on networks to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming connections are accepted.</description>
  <service name="ssh"/>
  <service name="dhcpv6-client"/>
  <service name="cockpit"/>
</zone>


[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/firewalld/zones/public.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<zone>
  <short>Public</short>
  <description>For use in public areas. You do not trust the other computers on networks to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming connections are accepted.</description>
  <service name="ssh"/>
  <service name="dhcpv6-client"/>
  <service name="cockpit"/>
  <service name="vnc-server"/>
  <service name="http"/>
  <port port="2022" protocol="tcp"/>
</zone>

# these services and port are accepted traffic.


2. Add runtime rules to the zone - add ports

# this changes the runtime config of the zone

[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --list-ports
2022/tcp
[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --add-port 443/tcp
success
[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --list-ports
2022/tcp 443/tcp


# it's not a permanent change

[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/firewalld/zones/public.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<zone>
  <short>Public</short>
  <description>For use in public areas. You do not trust the other computers on networks to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming connections are accepted.</description>
  <service name="ssh"/>
  <service name="dhcpv6-client"/>
  <service name="cockpit"/>
  <service name="vnc-server"/>
  <service name="http"/>
  <port port="2022" protocol="tcp"/>
</zone>


3. Add permanent rules (static) to the zone - add ports

[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --add-port 5901-5910/tcp --permanent --zone internal
success

[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/firewalld/zones/internal.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<zone>
  <short>Internal</short>
  <description>For use on internal networks. You mostly trust the other computers on the networks to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming connections are accepted.</description>
  <service name="ssh"/>
  <service name="mdns"/>
  <service name="samba-client"/>
  <service name="dhcpv6-client"/>
  <service name="cockpit"/>
  <port port="5901-5910" protocol="tcp"/>
</zone>


4. switch zone and activate the new rules

Switch zone by change the default zone.
Further update will be applied to the new default zone.

Because only default zone accepts changes to the runtime rules.

If you want to activate the new rules to a non-default zone, you need to set it as a default zone.

Because non-default zone accept changes to the permanent rules only. If change needs to be made to the runtime, you need to push it to the runtime by
firewall-cmd --reload
This command works on the default zone only. You need to set it as the default zone in order to make the change happen.

[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --set-default-zone internal
success
[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
internal

Activate the new rules in the zone. Push the permanent config (static) to the runtime.

[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
success

Confirm
[root@localhost ~]# firewall-cmd --list-ports
5901-5910/tcp

FIREWALL-CMD(1)                            firewall-cmd                            FIREWALL-CMD(1)

NAME
       firewall-cmd - firewalld command line client

SYNOPSIS
       firewall-cmd [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
       firewall-cmd is the command line client of the firewalld daemon. It provides interface to
       manage runtime and permanent configuration.

       The runtime configuration in firewalld is separated from the permanent configuration. This
       means that things can get changed in the runtime or permanent configuration.

   Permanent Options
       --permanent
           The permanent option --permanent can be used to set options permanently. These changes
           are not effective immediately, only after service restart/reload or system reboot.
           Without the --permanent option, a change will only be part of the runtime
           configuration.

           If you want to make a change in runtime and permanent configuration, use the same call
           with and without the --permanent option.

           The --permanent option can be optionally added to all options further down where it is
           supported.

...
       --reload
           Reload firewall rules and keep state information. Current permanent configuration will
           become new runtime configuration, i.e. all runtime only changes done until reload are
           lost with reload if they have not been also in permanent configuration.

           Note: Runtime changes applied via the direct interface are not affected and will
           therefore stay in place until firewalld daemon is restarted completely.
       
   Options to Adapt and Query Zones
       Options in this section affect only one particular zone. If used with --zone=zone option,
       they affect the zone zone. If the option is omitted, they affect default zone (see
       --get-default-zone).

       [--permanent] [--zone=zone] --add-service=service [--timeout=timeval]
           Add a service for zone. If zone is omitted, default zone will be used. This option can
           be specified multiple times. If a timeout is supplied, the rule will be active for the
           specified amount of time and will be removed automatically afterwards.  timeval is
           either a number (of seconds) or number followed by one of characters s (seconds), m
           (minutes), h (hours), for example 20m or 1h.

           The service is one of the firewalld provided services. To get a list of the supported
           services, use firewall-cmd --get-services.

           The --timeout option is not combinable with the --permanent option.

       [--permanent] [--zone=zone] --add-port=portid[-portid]/protocol [--timeout=timeval]
           Add the port for zone. If zone is omitted, default zone will be used. This option can
           be specified multiple times. If a timeout is supplied, the rule will be active for the
           specified amount of time and will be removed automatically afterwards.  timeval is
           either a number (of seconds) or number followed by one of characters s (seconds), m
           (minutes), h (hours), for example 20m or 1h.

           The port can either be a single port number or a port range portid-portid. The protocol
           can either be tcp, udp, sctp or dccp.

           The --timeout option is not combinable with the --permanent option.
