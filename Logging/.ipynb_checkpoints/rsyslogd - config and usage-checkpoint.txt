rsyslogd (8)         - reliable and extended syslogd

FILES
       /etc/rsyslog.conf
              Configuration file for rsyslogd.  See rsyslog.conf(5) for  exact
              information.
       /dev/log
              The  Unix  domain socket to from where local syslog messages are
              read.
       /var/run/rsyslogd.pid
              The file containing the process id of rsyslogd.
       prefix/lib/rsyslog
              Default directory for rsyslogd modules. The prefix is specified
              during compilation (e.g. /usr/local).

another config file not mentioned in man page:
/etc/sysconfig/rsyslog file

It's not recommended to change it. Because this opetion is included in Systemd confg file that starts rsyslogd

By default it contains only one line.
SYSLOGD_OPTIONS="" to specify the startup parameter

It defines the startup parameter of rsyslogd. It's defined by systemd. 


[root@localhost log]# cat /etc/sysconfig/rsyslog
# Options for rsyslogd
# Syslogd options are deprecated since rsyslog v3.
# If you want to use them, switch to compatibility mode 2 by "-c 2"
# See rsyslogd(8) for more details
SYSLOGD_OPTIONS=""


Understand rsyslogd config file /etc/rsyslog.conf

	Modules					rsyslogd is modular, add enhanced supported feature here
	GLOBAL DIRECTIVES		define global parameters
	RULES					the most important part. It specifies what should be logged to which destination.



$ less /etc/rsyslog.conf

#### GLOBAL DIRECTIVES ####

# Where to place auxiliary files
global(workDirectory="/var/lib/rsyslog")

# Use default timestamp format
module(load="builtin:omfile" Template="RSYSLOG_TraditionalFileFormat")

# Include all config files in /etc/rsyslog.d/
include(file="/etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf" mode="optional")

-> /etc/rsyslog.d could be populated by installing RPM packages on the server. The content in that directory is also included in the config.

#### RULES ####

# Log all kernel messages to the console.
# Logging much else clutters up the screen.
#kern.*                                                 /dev/console

# Log anything (except mail) of level info or higher.
# Don't log private authentication messages!
*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none                /var/log/messages

# The authpriv file has restricted access.
authpriv.*                                              /var/log/secure

# Log all the mail messages in one place.
mail.*                                                  -/var/log/maillog    -> writes to a buffer first and /var/log/maillog later


# Log cron stuff
cron.*                                                  /var/log/cron

*.emerg                                                 :omusrmsg:*        -> writes to a rsyslog module - omusrmsg

# Save news errors of level crit and higher in a special file.
uucp,news.crit                                          /var/log/spooler

# Save boot messages also to boot.log
local7.*                                                /var/log/boot.log



	In rules, you'll define
    
    facility.priority  location

	facility:
		It's the category of information. Facilities' list is fixed for backward compatibility with legacy syslog service. Msg from one facility will be written to the corresponding log files in /var

	priority:
		all msg with that priority and all that with higher priorities are logged

	destination:
		usually it's file: /var or device file /dev
		it could be rsyslogd modules, that way it will be further processed by rsyslogd modules



location = -/var/log/maillog; the hyphen in the front means it's not directly written to the file. There's a buffer used to make write more efficient.

NAME
       logger - enter messages into the system log

SYNOPSIS
       logger [options] [message]

DESCRIPTION
       logger makes entries in the system log.

       When the optional message argument is present, it is written to the log.  If it is not
       present, and the -f option is not given either, then standard input is logged.

       -P, --port port
              Use the specified port.  When this option is not specified, the  port  defaults
              to syslog for udp and to syslog-conn for tcp connections.

       -p, --priority priority
              Enter  the  message into the log with the specified priority.  The priority may
              be specified  numerically  or  as  a  facility.level  pair.   For  example,  -p
              local3.info  logs  the  message  as  informational in the local3 facility.  The
              default is user.notice.

FACILITIES AND LEVELS
       Valid facility names are:

              auth
              authpriv   for security information of a sensitive nature
              cron
              daemon
              ftp
              kern       cannot be generated from userspace process, automatically converted to 
user
              lpr
              mail
              news
              syslog
              user
              uucp
              local0
                to
              local7
              security   deprecated synonym for auth

       Valid level names are:

              emerg
              alert
              crit
              err
              warning
              notice
              info
              debug
              panic     deprecated synonym for emerg
              error     deprecated synonym for err
              warn      deprecated synonym for warning

       For the priority order and intended purposes of these facilities and levels, see  sys‚Äê
       log(3).


	Because we use the fixed set of facilities to work with legacy syslog service.

	To support new services, you can use 
		1. daemon facility can be used by daemon services
		2. local0-local7 can be used by other services such as apache web service.
        You'll need to configure the service to use the facility and modify the rsyslog config.

	The service writes msg to a facility, so the loggging service can collect the msg from a facility and write it to a specific file.
