NAME
       logrotate ‚Äê rotates, compresses, and mails system logs

       logrotate  [--debug]  [--verbose]  [--log  file]  [--force]  [--state  file]

DESCRIPTION
       logrotate is designed to ease administration of systems that generate  large
       numbers  of  log files.  It allows automatic rotation, compression, removal,
       and mailing of log files.  Each log  file  may  be  handled  daily,  weekly,
       monthly, or when it grows too large.

   DIRECTIVES
       These directives may be included in a logrotate configuration file:

       compress
              Old versions of log files are compressed with gzip(1) by default. See
              also nocompress.

        ....
