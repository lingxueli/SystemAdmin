Locate and interpret system log files and journals

Log file could be from:

1. direct write by the service, such as httpd
2. rsyslog, an upgrade from syslog. Logs from this service are centralized
3. journal. It collects messages from the kernel, the entire boot procedure and Systemd.

journal log is not persistent. It can forward logs to rsyslog to keep logs between reboot.

Audit service for SELinux.


So you can locate the log files from:

1. read rsyslog log from /var/log

2. read journal log by journalctl (log file is binary)
or systemctl status XXX. It shows the most recent log.
