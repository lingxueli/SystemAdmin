LOGROTATE(8)               System Administrator's Manual               LOGROTATE(8)

NAME
       logrotate ‐ rotates, compresses, and mails system logs

SYNOPSIS
       logrotate  [--debug]  [--verbose]  [--log  file]  [--force]  [--state  file]
       [--mail command] config_file [config_file2 ...]

DESCRIPTION
       logrotate is designed to ease administration of systems that generate  large
       numbers  of  log files.  It allows automatic rotation, compression, removal,
       and mailing of log files.  Each log  file  may  be  handled  daily,  weekly,
       monthly, or when it grows too large.

   DIRECTIVES
       These directives may be included in a logrotate configuration file:

       compress
              Old versions of log files are compressed with gzip(1) by default. See
              also nocompress.

        ....
FILES
       /var/lib/logrotate/logrotate.status   Default state file.
       /etc/logrotate.conf                   Configuration options.


[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/logrotate.conf   
# see "man logrotate" for details
# rotate log files weekly
weekly

# keep 4 weeks worth of backlogs
rotate 4

# create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones
create

# use date as a suffix of the rotated file

NAME
       logrotate ‐ rotates, compresses, and mails system logs

SYNOPSIS
       logrotate  [--debug]  [--verbose]  [--log  file]  [--force]  [--state  file] [--mail command] config_file [con‐
       fig_file2 ...]

DESCRIPTION
       logrotate is designed to ease administration of systems that generate large numbers of log  files.   It  allows
       automatic  rotation,  compression,  removal,  and  mailing  of  log files.  Each log file may be handled daily,
       weekly, monthly, or when it grows too large.

       Normally, logrotate is run as a daily cron job.  It will not modify a log more than once in one day unless  the
       criterion for that log is based on the log's size and logrotate is being run more than once each day, or unless
       the -f or --force option is used.
       
CONFIGURATION FILE
       logrotate reads everything about the log files it should be handling from the  series  of  configuration  files
       specified  on  the  command  line.   Each configuration file can set global options (local definitions override
       global ones, and later definitions override earlier ones) and specify logfiles to rotate. A  simple  configura‐
       tion file looks like this:

       # sample logrotate configuration file
       compress

       /var/log/messages {
           rotate 5
           weekly
           postrotate
               /usr/bin/killall -HUP syslogd
           endscript
       }

       "/var/log/httpd/access.log" /var/log/httpd/error.log {
           rotate 5
           mail recipient@example.org
           size 100k
           sharedscripts
           postrotate
               /usr/bin/killall -HUP httpd
           endscript
       }

       /var/log/news/* {
           monthly
           rotate 2
           olddir /var/log/news/old
           missingok
           postrotate
               kill -HUP $(cat /var/run/inn.pid)
           endscript
           nocompress
       }

       ~/log/*.log {}

       The  first few lines set global options; in the example, logs are compressed after they are rotated.  Note that
       comments may appear anywhere in the config file as long as the first non-whitespace character on the line is a
       #.

       Values are separated from directives by whitespace and/or an optional =.  Numbers must be specified in a format
       understood by strtoul(3).

       The next section of the config file defines how to handle the log  file  /var/log/messages.  The  log  will  go
       through  five  weekly  rotations  before being removed. After the log file has been rotated (but before the old
       version of the log has been compressed), the command /usr/bin/killall -HUP syslogd will be executed.

       The next section defines the parameters for both /var/log/httpd/access.log and /var/log/httpd/error.log.   Each
       is  rotated whenever it grows over 100k in size, and the old logs files are mailed (uncompressed) to recipient@
       example.org after going through 5 rotations, rather than  being  removed.  The  sharedscripts  means  that  the
       postrotate  script will only be run once (after the old logs have been compressed), not once for each log which
       is rotated.  Note that log file names may be enclosed in quotes (and that quotes are required if the name  con‐
       tains spaces).  Normal shell quoting rules apply, with ', ", and \ characters supported.

       The  next  section  defines  the  parameters  for  all of the files in /var/log/news. Each file is rotated on a
       monthly basis.  This is considered a single rotation directive and if errors occur for more than one file,  the
       log files are not compressed.

       The  last  section  uses tilde expansion to rotate log files in the home directory of the current user. This is
       only available, if your glob library supports tilde expansion. GNU glob does support this.

       Please use wildcards with caution.  If you specify *, logrotate will rotate  all  files,  including  previously
       rotated ones.  A way around this is to use the olddir directive or a more exact wildcard (such as *.log).

       Here is more information on the directives which may be included in a logrotate configuration file:

   DIRECTIVES
       These directives may be included in a logrotate configuration file:

       compress
              Old versions of log files are compressed with gzip(1) by default. See also nocompress.

       daily  Log files are rotated every day.

       mail address
              When a log is rotated out of existence, it is mailed to address. If no mail should  be  generated  by  a
              particular log, the nomail directive may be used.

       postrotate/endscript
              The lines between postrotate and endscript (both of which must appear on lines by themselves)  are  exe‐
              cuted  (using /bin/sh) after the log file is rotated. These directives may only appear inside a log file
              definition. Normally, the absolute path to the log file is passed as first argument to  the  script.  If
              sharedscripts  is  specified,  whole  pattern  is passed to the script.  See also prerotate. See shared‐
              scripts and nosharedscripts for error handling.
              
       rotate count
              Log files are rotated count times before being removed or mailed to the  address  specified  in  a  mail
              directive. If count is 0, old versions are removed rather than rotated. Default is 0.

       size size
              Log files are rotated only if they grow bigger than size bytes. If size is followed by k,  the  size  is
              assumed  to  be in kilobytes.  If the M is used, the size is in megabytes, and if G is used, the size is
              in gigabytes. So size 100, size 100k, size 100M and size 100G are all valid.

       maxsize size
              Log  files are rotated when they grow bigger than size bytes even before the additionally specified time
              interval (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly).  The related size option is  similar  except  that  it  is
              mutually  exclusive with the time interval options, and it causes log files to be rotated without regard
              for the last rotation time.  When maxsize is used, both the size and timestamp of a log file are consid‐
              ered.

       minsize  size
              Log  files  are rotated when they grow bigger than size bytes, but not before the additionally specified
              time interval (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly).  The related size option is similar except that it is
              mutually  exclusive with the time interval options, and it causes log files to be rotated without regard
              for the last rotation time.  When minsize is used, both the size and timestamp of a log file are consid‐
              ered.

FILES
       /var/lib/logrotate/logrotate.status   Default state file.
       /etc/logrotate.conf                   Configuration options.

#
# Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point
# ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the
