# this tutorial forward httpd log to rsyslogd. Httpd was to send the logs directly to the file. Now it's configured to send to the facility as well.
# Configuration needs to be done on both sides: httpd and rsyslog
# httpd sends the log to the rsyslog facility, local1
# rsyslog receives the log from the facility and forward the log to the local directories: /var/log

# install httpd, installed


# config httpd service to use the log service in a desired way

NAME
       httpd.conf - Configuration files for httpd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf, /etc/httpd/conf.modules.d, /etc/httpd/conf.d


# locate the lines to config logging

[root@localhost ~]# grep -B10 log /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/directives.html>
# for a discussion of each configuration directive.
#
# See the httpd.conf(5) man page for more information on this configuration,
# and httpd.service(8) on using and configuring the httpd service.
#
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.  
#
# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's control files begin with "/" (or "drive:/" for Win32), the
# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
# with "/", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so 'log/access_log'
# with ServerRoot set to '/www' will be interpreted by the
# server as '/www/log/access_log', where as '/log/access_log' will be
# interpreted as '/log/access_log'.


#
# ErrorLog: The location of the error log file.
# If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a <VirtualHost>
# container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be
# logged here.  If you *do* define an error logfile for a <VirtualHost>
# container, that host's errors will be logged there and not here.
#
ErrorLog "logs/error_log"

#
# LogLevel: Control the number of messages logged to the error_log.
# Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
# alert, emerg.
#
LogLevel warn



# update httpd to send the log to rsyslog local1
$ vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
#

$ man httpd.conf

   Configuration structure
       The main configuration file (httpd.conf) sets up various defaults and
       includes configuration files from two directories -
       /etc/httpd/conf.modules.d and /etc/httpd/conf.d. Packages containing
       loadable modules (like mod_ssl.so) place files in the conf.modules.d
       directory with the appropriate LoadModule directive so that module is loaded
       by default.

       Some notable configured defaults are:.

       DocumentRoot /var/www/html
           The default document root from which content is served.

       Listen 80
           The daemon lists on TCP port 80.

       ErrorLog "logs/error_log"
           Error messages are logged to /var/log/httpd/error_log.


# restart the service to reload the config
[root@localhost ~]# systemctl restart httpd



# rsyslog forwards the log from local1 to /var/log
[root@localhost ~]# man 5 rsyslog.conf

Another example - config the log msg forwarding based on priority rather than facility


# forward debug msg to a new file
$ echo "*.debug /var/log/messages-debug" > /etc/rsyslog.d/debug.conf
$ systemctl restart rsyslog

[root@localhost rsyslog.d]# tail -f /var/log/messages-debug
