logging services

	1. direct write from services
    
	2. rsyslogd:
		it offers features that are not offered by journald, such as centralized logging and modules to filter the msg
		it offers addition modules to enhance logging, such as output modules that allows admin to store msg in a database
		persistent between reboots
		allow remote logging and log servers

	3. journald: 
		integrated with Systemd, so it logs everything that your service is doing
		journald is not persistent between reboots. So msg are forwarded to rsyslogd service, which writes to /var/log(file in this directory is presitent between reboots)
		msg is stored in binary format, which can be processed by journalctl command

How to use the logging services?

Administrator can access the log in three ways
	1. monitor /var/log written mostly by rsyslogd, or by specific services
	2. use journalctl to get info from journald
	3. use systemctl status <unit> to get a short overview of the last significant events that have been logged. You'll see the last couple lines of the log there.
