NAME
       auditd - The Linux Audit daemon

SYNOPSIS
       auditd [-f] [-l] [-n] [-s disable|enable|nochange] [-c <config_dir>]

DESCRIPTION
       auditd  is  the userspace component to the Linux Auditing System. It's responsible for writing audit records to
       the disk. Viewing the logs is done with the ausearch or aureport utilities. Configuring  the  audit  system  or
       loading  rules  is done with the auditctl utility. During startup, the rules in /etc/audit/audit.rules are read
       by auditctl and loaded into the kernel. Alternately, there is also  an  augenrules  program  that  reads  rules
       located  in  /etc/audit/rules.d/  and  compiles them into an audit.rules file. The audit daemon itself has some
       configuration options that the admin may wish to customize. They are found in the auditd.conf file.

FILES
       /etc/audit/auditd.conf - configuration file for audit daemon

       /etc/audit/audit.rules - audit rules to be loaded at startup

       /etc/audit/rules.d/ - directory holding individual sets of rules to be compiled into one file by augenrules.

       /etc/audit/plugins.d/ - directory holding individual plugin configuration files.

       /var/run/auditd.state - report about internal state.
