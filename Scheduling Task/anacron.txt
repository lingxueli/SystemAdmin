NAME
       /etc/anacrontab - configuration file for Anacron

DESCRIPTION
       The  /etc/anacrontab  configuration  file  describes  the jobs controlled by anacron(8).  It can contain three types of lines: job-
       description lines, environment assignments, or empty lines.

       Job-description lines can have the following format:

          period in days   delay in minutes   job-identifier   command

       The period in days variable specifies the frequency of execution of a job in days.  This variable can be represented by an  integer
       or  a  macro (@daily, @weekly, @monthly), where @daily denotes the same value as the integer 1, @weekly the same as 7, and @monthly
       specifies that the job is run once a month, independent on the length of the month.

       The delay in minutes variable specifies the number of minutes anacron waits, if necessary, before executing a job.   This  variable
       is represented by an integer where 0 means no delay.

       The job-identifier variable specifies a unique name of a job which is used in the log files.

       The command variable specifies the command to execute.  The command can either be a command such as ls /proc >> /tmp/proc or a com‚Äê
       mand to execute a custom script.


# /etc/cron.hourly or daily or weekly or montnly files executes the command periodically. The exact time of execution doesn't matter.
