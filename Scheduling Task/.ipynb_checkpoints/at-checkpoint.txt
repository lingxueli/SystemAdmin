NAME
       at, batch, atq, atrm - queue, examine or delete jobs for later execution

DESCRIPTION
       at and batch read commands from standard input or a specified file which are to be executed at a later time, using /bin/sh.

       at      executes commands at a specified time.

       atq     lists  the user's pending jobs, unless the user is the superuser; in that case, everybody's jobs are listed.  The format of
               the output lines (one for each job) is: Job number, date, hour, queue, and username.

       atrm    deletes jobs, identified by their job number.

       batch   executes commands when system load levels permit; in other words, when the load average drops below 0.8, or the value spec‐
               ified in the invocation of atd.
