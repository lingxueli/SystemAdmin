       [-I|-D] [-e directory] pathname ...

       [-p] [-v] [-i] [-F] [-W] [-I|-D]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page describes the restorecon program.

       This program is primarily used to set the  security  context
       (extended attributes) on one or more files.

       It can also be run at any other time to correct inconsistent
       labels, to add support for  newly-installed  policy  or,  by
       using  the  -n  option,  to passively check whether the file
       contexts are all set  as  specified  by  the  active  policy
       (default behavior).

       -R, -r change files and directories file  labels  recursively  (descend
              directories).

       -v     show  changes  in  file labels. Multiple -v options increase the
              verbosity. Note that the -v and -p options are  mutually  exclu‐
              sive.

# take the context of /etc/hosts as an example. 
# Show the original context
[root@localhost ~]# ls -Z /etc/hosts
system_u:object_r:net_conf_t:s0 /etc/hosts

# the copy of this file takes a different context.
# when the new file is created/copied, the file inherites the context from the parent directory
[root@localhost ~]# cp /etc/hosts ~
[root@localhost ~]# ls -Z ~/hosts
unconfined_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0 /root/hosts
[root@localhost ~]# mv ~/hosts /etc
mv: overwrite '/etc/hosts'? y
[root@localhost ~]# ls -Z /etc/hosts
unconfined_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0 /etc/hosts

# It's copied from root directory, when doing the cp, the context is not preserved.
# If you want to preserve the context during the cp, use the option --perserve=context

# restore the default context by restorecon
# it restores the default context
[root@localhost ~]# restorecon -v /etc/hosts
Relabeled /etc/hosts from unconfined_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0 to unconfined_u:object_r:net_conf_t:s0


# relabel during the boot process, it restores the default context of all files after restart
[root@localhost ~]# touch /.autorelabel
$ reboot


# how to relabel the file system
$ restorecon -Rv /

# auto relabel during the reboot
# create a file /.autorelabel
$ touch /.autorelabel

NAME
       SELinux - NSA Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)

       The  best  way  to  relabel  the file system is to create the flag file
       /.autorelabel and reboot.  system-config-selinux, also has  this  capa‐
       bility.   The restorecon/fixfiles commands are also available for rela‐
       beling files.
