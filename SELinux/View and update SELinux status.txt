NAME
       SELinux - NSA Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)

DESCRIPTION
       NSA  Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is an implementation of a flexi‐
       ble mandatory access control architecture in the Linux  operating  sys‐
       tem.   The  SELinux  architecture  provides  general  support  for  the
       enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, includ‐
       ing  those  based  on  the  concepts  of Type Enforcement®, Role- Based
       Access Control, and Multi-Level Security.  Background  information  and
       technical    documentation    about    SELinux    can   be   found   at
       http://www.nsa.gov/research/selinux.

       The /etc/selinux/config configuration file controls whether SELinux  is
       enabled  or  disabled, and if enabled, whether SELinux operates in per‐
       missive mode or enforcing mode.  The SELINUX variable may be set to any
       one  of  disabled,  permissive,  or  enforcing  to  select one of these
       options.  The disabled option completely disables  the  SELinux  kernel
       and  application  code,  leaving the system running without any SELinux
       protection.  The permissive option enables the SELinux code, but causes
       it  to  operate in a mode where accesses that would be denied by policy
       are permitted but audited.  The enforcing option  enables  the  SELinux
       code  and causes it to enforce access denials as well as auditing them.
       Permissive mode may yield a different set  of  denials  than  enforcing
       mode,  both  because enforcing mode will prevent an operation from pro‐
       ceeding past the first denial and because some  application  code  will
       fall back to a less privileged mode of operation if denied access.

setenforce(8)         SELinux Command Line documentation         setenforce(8)

NAME
       setenforce - modify the mode SELinux is running in

SYNOPSIS
       setenforce [Enforcing|Permissive|1|0]

DESCRIPTION
       Use Enforcing or 1 to put SELinux in enforcing mode.
       Use Permissive or 0 to put SELinux in permissive mode.

       If SELinux is disabled and you want to enable it, or SELinux is enabled
       and you want to disable it, please see selinux(8).


sestatus (8)         - SELinux status tool
sestatus(8)           SELinux command line documentation           sestatus(8)

NAME
       sestatus - SELinux status tool

SYNOPSIS
       sestatus [-v] [-b]

       This tool is used to get the status of a system running SELinux.

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page describes the sestatus program.

       This  tool  is  used  to get the status of a system running SELinux. It
       displays data about whether SELinux is enabled or disabled, location of
       key  directories, and the loaded policy with its status as shown in the
       example:
              > sestatus
              SELinux status:              enabled
              SELinuxfs mount:             /selinux
              SELinux root directory:      /etc/selinux
              Loaded policy name:          targeted
              Current mode:                permissive
              Mode from config file:       enforcing
              Policy MLS status:           enabled
              Policy deny_unknown status:  allow
              Memory protection checking:  actual (secure)
              Max kernel policy version:   26

OPTIONS
       -v
              Displays the contexts of  files  and  processes  listed  in  the
              /etc/sestatus.conf  file.  It  also checks whether the file is a
              symbolic link, if so then the context of the target file is also
              shown.

              The following contexts will always be displayed:
                     The current process context
                     The init process context
                     The controlling terminal file context

Example:

# view current status of SELinux
[root@localhost ~]# getenforce
Enforcing


# Enable SELinux for the current session

$ setenforce 0
$ getenforce

# if it s disabled, edit the config file and change it to enforcing. The change would be persisitent between reboot. 

# After change, reboot the system before continue. Because SELinux is part of the kernel.

[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/sysconfig/selinux

# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=enforcing
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these three values:
#     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
#     minimum - Modification of targeted policy. Only selected processes are protected. 
#     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
SELINUXTYPE=targeted


Example

1. disable SELinux

set SELinux=disabled in the config file /etc/sysconfig/selinux
$ reboot
$ getenforce

2. Change the status from disabled to enforcing for the current session

$ setenforce 1
You'll receive the error msg as stated in the man page of setenforce

3. Make the change persistent
set SELinux=enforcing in the config file /etc/sysconfig/selinux
$ reboot
$ sestatis -v

Now the status is changed successfully.
