PROCESS TYPES
       SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system

       You can see the context of a process using the -Z option to ps

       Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.  SELinux auditd policy  is  very  flexible  allowing
       users to setup their auditd processes in as secure a method as possible.

       The following process types are defined for auditd:

       auditd_t

       Note: semanage permissive -a auditd_t can be used to make the process type auditd_t permissive. SELinux does not
       deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

MANAGED FILES
       The SELinux process type auditd_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed  are
       the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

       anon_inodefs_t

       auditd_log_t

            /var/log/audit(/.*)?
            /var/log/audit.log.*


Example to analysi SELinux denial msg in the log file

log file: /var/log/audit/audit.log
type=AVC
$ grep AVC /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep http

avc: denied {map}
# a map request was denied. the map request is to read attributes of a file, i.e. getattr

comm="httpd" 
# command that issues the getattr request

path="web/index.html"
# the file it tries to access


scontext=system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0  
# source context is set to httpd_t

tcontext=unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0  
# target context is set to default_t

SELinux disallow the access from the source context to the target context
To fix this, relabel the file to use the default context
