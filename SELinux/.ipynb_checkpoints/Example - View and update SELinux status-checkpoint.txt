1. switch between disable and enable mode requires reboot. 

It requires reboot because selinux is deeply interwoven with the Linux kernel.

It should be changed via the config file. 

Because the config file makes the change persistent between the reboot. 

2. switch between enable modes, i.e. enforcing and permissive, doesn't require reboot. 

It can be done by command such as setenforce. 
To make the change persistent, update the config file.

Example - switch between enable modes

# view current status of SELinux
[root@localhost ~]# getenforce
Enforcing


# Enable SELinux for the current session

$ setenforce 0
$ getenforce


[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/sysconfig/selinux

# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=enforcing
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these three values:
#     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
#     minimum - Modification of targeted policy. Only selected processes are protected. 
#     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
SELINUXTYPE=targeted


Example - switch between disable and enable

It's currently in the enforcing mode.

1. disable SELinux

set SELinux=disabled in the config file /etc/sysconfig/selinux
$ reboot
$ getenforce

Now it's disabled.

2. Change the status from disabled to enforcing for the current session

$ setenforce 1
You'll receive the error msg. Because the switch from disabled to enabled requires a reboot.

3. Set up the change in the config file and reboot

set SELinux=enforcing in the config file /etc/sysconfig/selinux
$ reboot
$ sestatis -v

Now the status is changed successfully.
