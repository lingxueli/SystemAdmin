How to find the appropriate context type

1. look at the default environment
2. read the configuration files
3. use man -k _selinux to find the SELinux-specific man page.

    $ man -k _selinux
    It searches the database of man pages for manuals that match _selinux in the name/description.
    it's not provided by default so you need to know how to install it.


How to install the man pages of SELinux-specific man page i.e. _selinux

By default these are not provided. You will need to 
1. install the package that provides SELinux policy - "sepolicy"
2. Then generates the man page based on sepolicy.
3. Sync man db.


After it's installed, find the man page that documents SELinux settings for httpd service

NAME
       httpd_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the httpd processes

DESCRIPTION
       Security-Enhanced Linux secures the httpd processes via flexible manda‚Äê
       tory access control.

       The httpd processes execute with the  httpd_t  SELinux  type.  You  can
       check  if  you have these processes running by executing the ps command
       with the -Z qualifier.

       For example:

       ps -eZ | grep httpd_t
