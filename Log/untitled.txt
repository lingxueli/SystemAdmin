Three sources of logging
	1. direct write from services
	2. rsyslogd:
		centralized logging
		modules to filtering the msg
		addition modules such output module to store msg in a database
		persistent between reboots
		allow remote logging and log servers
	3. journald: 
		integrated with Systemd, so it logs everything that your service is doing
		journald is not persistent between reboots. So msg are forwarded to rsyslogd service, which writes to /var/log(file in this directory is presitent between reboots)
		msg is stored in binary format, which can be processed by journalctl command

Auditd service
	more in-depth trace of the activities than logging service
	SELinux logs detailed messages to the auditd service

Admin can access the log in three ways
	1. monitor /var/log written by rsyslogd
	2. use journalctl to get info from journald
	3. use systemctl status <unit> to get a short overview of the last significant events that have been logged. You'll see the last couple lines of the log there.
