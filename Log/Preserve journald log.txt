[root@localhost ~]# killall -USR1 systemd-journald 

Inform systemd-journald that the new location should be used by sending a USR1 signal to it. A reboot will also suffice.

As suggested by several other locations, use killall -USR1 systemd-journald instead of restarting the service. This way you get to keep all the logging of the current session: the memory log gets copied to the new disk location as well as all subsequent events.



JOURNALCTL(1)                     journalctl                     JOURNALCTL(1)

NAME
       journalctl - Query the systemd journal

SYNOPSIS
       journalctl [OPTIONS...] [MATCHES...]

DESCRIPTION
       journalctl may be used to query the contents of the systemd(1) journal
       as written by systemd-journald.service(8).

       -b [ID][±offset], --boot=[ID][±offset]
           Show messages from a specific boot. This will add a match for
           "_BOOT_ID=".

           The argument may be empty, in which case logs for the current boot
           will be shown.
