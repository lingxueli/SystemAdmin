rsyslogd (8)         - reliable and extended syslogd

FILES
       /etc/rsyslog.conf
              Configuration file for rsyslogd.  See rsyslog.conf(5) for  exact
              information.
       /dev/log
              The  Unix  domain socket to from where local syslog messages are
              read.
       /var/run/rsyslogd.pid
              The file containing the process id of rsyslogd.
       prefix/lib/rsyslog
              Default directory for rsyslogd modules. The prefix is  specified
              during compilation (e.g. /usr/local).


Another config file is /etc/sysconfig/rsyslog file

It defines the startup parameter of rsyslogd. It's defined by systemd. By default it contains only one line.

SYSLOGD_OPTIONS="" 	specify startup parameter here.... It's not recommended to modify it here because this opetion is included in Systemd confg file that starts rsyslogd




$ less /etc/rsyslog.conf

#### GLOBAL DIRECTIVES ####

# Where to place auxiliary files
global(workDirectory="/var/lib/rsyslog")

# Use default timestamp format
module(load="builtin:omfile" Template="RSYSLOG_TraditionalFileFormat")

# Include all config files in /etc/rsyslog.d/
include(file="/etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf" mode="optional")



/etc/rsyslog.d could be populated by installing RPM packages on the server. The content in that directory is also included in the config.

$ less /etc/rsyslog.conf

format of rules
facility.priority  location

location = -/var/log/maillog; the hyphen in the front means it's not directly written to the file. There's a buffer used to make write more efficient.

NAME
       logger - enter messages into the system log

SYNOPSIS
       logger [options] [message]

DESCRIPTION
       logger makes entries in the system log.

       When the optional message argument is present, it is written to the log.  If it is not
       present, and the -f option is not given either, then standard input is logged.

       -P, --port port
              Use the specified port.  When this option is not specified, the  port  defaults
              to syslog for udp and to syslog-conn for tcp connections.

       -p, --priority priority
              Enter  the  message into the log with the specified priority.  The priority may
              be specified  numerically  or  as  a  facility.level  pair.   For  example,  -p
              local3.info  logs  the  message  as  informational in the local3 facility.  The
              default is user.notice.
