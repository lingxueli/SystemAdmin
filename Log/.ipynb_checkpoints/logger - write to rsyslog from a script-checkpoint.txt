NAME
       logger - enter messages into the system log

SYNOPSIS
       logger [options] [message]

DESCRIPTION
       logger makes entries in the system log.

       When the optional message argument is present, it is written to the log.  If it is not
       present, and the -f option is not given either, then standard input is logged.

       -P, --port port
              Use the specified port.  When this option is not specified, the  port  defaults
              to syslog for udp and to syslog-conn for tcp connections.

       -p, --priority priority
              Enter  the  message into the log with the specified priority.  The priority may
              be specified  numerically  or  as  a  facility.level  pair.   For  example,  -p
              local3.info  logs  the  message  as  informational in the local3 facility.  The
              default is user.notice.
