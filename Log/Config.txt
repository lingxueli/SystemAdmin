Structure in log file directory

	Page 290 Table 12-3 understand what type of log files are in /var/log

----------------------------------------------------------
Read log file

	Page 291 Example 13-2 grab info from log file: tail -10 /var/log/messages
    	notice how host and services, process id are represented
    
-----------------------------------------------------------
Monitor log file

	tail -10 /var/log/messages		read last 10 line (static)
	tail -f /var/log/messages		read real time log

	Open two terminals, on the first terminal you configure and test the service, on the second terminal, use tail -f to observe the log
    
-----------------------------------------------------------
Write to log file

	use logger command, specify the facility and priority

	logger -p kern.err hello	write hello to kernel facility, with priority == error

	facility: log lines write to kernel facility will be stored in the specific log file, prob /var/log/dmesg (kernal log files)

-----------------------------------------------------------
Configuring rsyslogd

	/etc/rsyslogd.conf file: main log config file
	
	/etc/rsyslogd.d directory: log config from installed services, populated by installing RPM packages on a server

	/etc/sysconfig/rsyslog file: by default contains only one line
		SYSLOGD_OPTIONS="" 	specify startup parameter here.... It's not recommended to modify it here because this opetion is included in Systemd confg file that starts rsyslogd

-----------------------------------------------------------
Understand rsyslogd config file in /etc

	Modules					rsyslogd is modular, add enhanced supported feature here	
	GLOBAL DIRECTIVES		define global parameters
	RULES					the most important part. It specify what should be logged to which destination.

	In rules, you'll define

	facility:
		this is the category of information. Facilities' list is fixed for backward compatibility with legacy syslog service. Msg from one facility will be written to the corresponding log files in /var

	priority:
		all msg with that priority and all that with higher priorities are logged

	destination:
		usually it's file: /var or device file /dev
		it could be rsyslogd modules, that way it will be further processed by rsyslogd modules

	man 5 rsyslog.conf		contains rsyslogd facilities and priorities values
-----------------------------------------------------------
Understand rsyslogd facilites

	Page 295 Table 13-3 Understand rsyslogd Facilities
    
	Fixed set of facilities here to work with legacy syslog service.

	To support new services, you can use 
		1. daemon facility of daemon services
		2. local0-local7

	The service writes msg to a facility, so the loggging service can collect the msg from a facility and write it to a specific file. i.e. Service -> facility -> log file
    
-----------------------------------------------------------
Understand rysylogd priorities

	Page 296 Table 13-4
    
	cron.=debug -/var/log/cron.debug 	 use ""=" only write the msg with priority === debug (not msg with higher priority) from cron facility; use "-" write to buffer not directly to the log file(this is more efficiently)
