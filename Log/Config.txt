Structure in log file directory

	Page 290 Table 12-3 understand what type of log files are in /var/log

----------------------------------------------------------
Read log file

	Page 291 Example 13-2 grab info from log file: tail -10 /var/log/messages
    	notice how host and services, process id are represented
    
-----------------------------------------------------------
Monitor log file

	tail -10 /var/log/messages		read last 10 line (static)
	tail -f /var/log/messages		read real time log

	Open two terminals, on the first terminal you configure and test the service, on the second terminal, use tail -f to observe the log
    
-----------------------------------------------------------
Write to log file

	use logger command, specify the facility and priority

	logger -p kern.err hello	write hello to kernel facility, with priority == error

	facility: log lines write to kernel facility will be stored in the specific log file, prob /var/log/dmesg (kernal log files)

-----------------------------------------------------------
Configuring rsyslogd

	/etc/rsyslogd.conf file: main log config file
	
	/etc/rsyslogd.d directory: log config from installed services, populated by installing RPM packages on a server

	/etc/sysconfig/rsyslog file: by default contains only one line
		SYSLOGD_OPTIONS="" 	specify startup parameter here.... It's not recommended to modify it here because this opetion is included in Systemd confg file that starts rsyslogd
