	journald stores log msg in the a temporary binary file, /run/log/journal. use journalctl command to read it

	Because it works with systemd, it logs everything happening on the server but the log is not persistent between reboots. To keep them, you can forward the msg from journald to rsyslogd. rsyslogd will keep it in /var/log.


How to config journald log to be persisitent?

Configure the service writting log to /var/log/journal/, instead of /run/log/journal/

SYSTEMD-JOURNALD.SERVICE(8)                                  systemd-journald.service                                  SYSTEMD-JOURNALD.SERVICE(8)

NAME
       systemd-journald.service, systemd-journald.socket, systemd-journald - Journal service

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-journald.service

       systemd-journald.socket

       /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-journald

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-journald is a system service that collects and stores logging data. It creates and maintains structured, indexed journals based on
       logging information that is received from a variety of sources:

       ·   Kernel log messages, via kmsg

       ·   Simple system log messages, via the libc syslog(3) call

       ·   Structured system log messages via the native Journal API, see sd_journal_print(4)

       ·   Standard output and standard error of system services

       ·   Audit records, via the audit subsystem

FILES
       /etc/systemd/journald.conf
           Configure systemd-journald behaviour. See journald.conf(5).

       /run/log/journal/machine-id/*.journal, /run/log/journal/machine-id/*.journal~, /var/log/journal/machine-id/*.journal,
       /var/log/journal/machine-id/*.journal~
           systemd-journald writes entries to files in /run/log/journal/machine-id/ or /var/log/journal/machine-id/ with the ".journal" suffix. If
           the daemon is stopped uncleanly, or if the files are found to be corrupted, they are renamed using the ".journal~" suffix, and
           systemd-journald starts writing to a new file.  /run is used when /var/log/journal is not available, or when Storage=volatile is set in
           the journald.conf(5) configuration file.


JOURNALD.CONF(5)                                                   journald.conf                                                  JOURNALD.CONF(5)

NAME
       journald.conf, journald.conf.d - Journal service configuration files

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/systemd/journald.conf

       /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/*.conf

       /run/systemd/journald.conf.d/*.conf

       /usr/lib/systemd/journald.conf.d/*.conf

OPTIONS
       All options are configured in the "[Journal]" section:

       Storage=
           Controls where to store journal data. One of "volatile", "persistent", "auto" and "none". If "volatile", journal log data will be
           stored only in memory, i.e. below the /run/log/journal hierarchy (which is created if needed). If "persistent", data will be stored
           preferably on disk, i.e. below the /var/log/journal hierarchy (which is created if needed), with a fallback to /run/log/journal (which
           is created if needed), during early boot and if the disk is not writable.  "auto" is similar to "persistent" but the directory
           /var/log/journal is not created if needed, so that its existence controls where log data goes.  "none" turns off all storage, all log
           data received will be dropped. Forwarding to other targets, such as the console, the kernel log buffer, or a syslog socket will still
           work however. Defaults to "auto".
