1. install curl

yum install curl

rpm -qa | grep curl
# query all the packages installed


2. download the ISO image of installation

mkdir /Downloads

curl -o /Downloads/CentOS8Image.iso http://centos.host-engine.com/8.3.2011/isos/x86_64/
# download and save the file as /Downloads/CentOS8Image.iso

3. loop mount the iso image

mkdir -p /media/iso
# make parent directory if needed

[root@localhost ~]# mount -o loop /Downloads/CentOS8Image.iso /media/iso 
mount: /media/iso: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop1, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.

You receive the error because you need to convert ISO image to a loop device before mounting. ISO image itself is not a device.


From the man page of LOOP device, there's an example of creating the loop device from an ISO image

        $ dd if=/dev/zero of=file.img bs=1MiB count=10

        # this is to create an image, i.e. copy blocks from /dev/zero to file.img

		# dd: convert and copy a file
		# if=/dev/zero: read from file /dev/zero instead of stdin
		# of=file.img: write to file file.img instead of stdout
		# count=10: copy only 10 input blocks
		# bs=1MiB: read and write up to 1MiB bytes at a time (default: 512); overrides ibs and obs


        $ sudo losetup /dev/loop4 file.img

        # losetup - set up and control loop devices, i.e. create a loop device from the img

        $ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/loop4
        
        # make filesystem on top of the device

        $ sudo mkdir /myloopdev
        
        # create directory as a mount point

        $ sudo mount /dev/loop4 /myloopdev

        # mount filesystem/device to the mount point

[root@localhost ~]# sudo losetup /dev/loop1 /Downloads/CentOS8Image.iso
losetup: /Downloads/CentOS8Image.iso: Warning: file does not fit into a 512-byte sector; the end of the file will be ignored.

# The losetup seems to map file in 512-byte sectors. If file size is not multiples of 512, then the rest will be truncated. When mapping a file to /dev/loopX with losetup, for fiile which is smaller than 512 bytes it gives us following warning:
Warning: file is smaller than 512 bytes; the loop device may be useless or invisible for system tools.
For file which the size cannot be divided by 512:
Warning: file does not fit into a 512-byte sector; the end of the file will be ignored
This warning was added since util-linux ver 2.22 in this commit
