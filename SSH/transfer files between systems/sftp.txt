NAME
     sftp — secure file transfer program

SYNOPSIS
     sftp [-46aCfpqrv] [-B buffer_size] [-b batchfile] [-c cipher]
          [-D sftp_server_path] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file]
          [-J destination] [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port]
          [-R num_requests] [-S program] [-s subsystem | sftp_server]
          destination

DESCRIPTION
     sftp is a file transfer program, similar to ftp(1), which performs all
     operations over an encrypted ssh(1) transport.  It may also use many fea‐
     tures of ssh, such as public key authentication and compression.


     The destination may be specified either as [user@]host[:path] or as a URI
     in the form sftp://[user@]host[:port][/path].

     If the destination includes a path and it is not a directory, sftp will
     retrieve files automatically if a non-interactive authentication method
     is used; otherwise it will do so after successful interactive authentica‐
     tion.

     If no path is specified, or if the path is a directory, sftp will log in
     to the specified host and enter interactive command mode, changing to the
     remote directory if one was specified.  An optional trailing slash can be
     used to force the path to be interpreted as a directory.
INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
     Once in interactive mode, sftp understands a set of commands similar to
     those of ftp(1).  Commands are case insensitive.  Pathnames that contain
     spaces must be enclosed in quotes.  Any special characters contained
     within pathnames that are recognized by glob(3) must be escaped with
     backslashes (‘\’).

     bye     Quit sftp.

     cd [path]
             Change remote directory to path.  If path is not specified, then
             change directory to the one the session started in.

     lcd [path]
             Change local directory to path.  If path is not specified, then
             change directory to the local user's home directory.


     get [-afPpr] remote-path [local-path]
             Retrieve the remote-path and store it on the local machine.  If
             the local path name is not specified, it is given the same name
             it has on the remote machine.  remote-path may contain glob(7)
             characters and may match multiple files.  If it does and
             local-path is specified, then local-path must specify a direc‐
             tory.

     put [-afPpr] local-path [remote-path]
             Upload local-path and store it on the remote machine.  If the
             remote path name is not specified, it is given the same name it
             has on the local machine.  local-path may contain glob(7) charac‐
             ters and may match multiple files.  If it does and remote-path is
             specified, then remote-path must specify a directory.
