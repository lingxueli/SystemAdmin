SCP(1)                    BSD General Commands Manual                   SCP(1)

NAME
     scp — secure copy (remote file copy program)

SYNOPSIS
     scp [-346BCpqrTv] [-c cipher] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file]
         [-J destination] [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-S program]
         source ... target

DESCRIPTION
     scp copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses ssh(1) for data
     transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the same security
     as ssh(1).  scp will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed
     for authentication.

     The source and target may be specified as a local pathname, a remote host
     with optional path in the form [user@]host:[path], or a URI in the form
     scp://[user@]host[:port][/path].  Local file names can be made explicit
     using absolute or relative pathnames to avoid scp treating file names
     containing ‘:’ as host specifiers.

     -r      Recursively copy entire directories.  Note that scp follows sym‐
             bolic links encountered in the tree traversal.

     -P port
             Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.  Note that
             this option is written with a capital ‘P’, because -p is already
             reserved for preserving the times and modes of the file.
