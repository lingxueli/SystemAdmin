How to disable root login

1. modify sshd config, not ssh config

Update the following: 

PermitRootLogin no

[root@localhost ~]# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

#       $OpenBSD: sshd_config,v 1.103 2018/04/09 20:41:22 tj Exp $

# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.  See
# sshd_config(5) for more information.

# This sshd was compiled with PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin

# The strategy used for options in the default sshd_config shipped with
# OpenSSH is to specify options with their default value where
# possible, but leave them commented.  Uncommented options override the
# default value.

# If you want to change the port on a SELinux system, you have to tell
# SELinux about this change.
# semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp #PORTNUMBER


#Port 22
#AddressFamily any
#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
#ListenAddress ::


# Authentication:

#LoginGraceTime 2m
PermitRootLogin yes
#StrictModes yes
#MaxAuthTries 6
#MaxSessions 10


2. restart sshd service

$ systemctl restart sshd

SSHD_CONFIG(5)                        BSD File Formats Manual                       SSHD_CONFIG(5)

NAME
     sshd_config — OpenSSH SSH daemon configuration file

DESCRIPTION
     sshd(8) reads configuration data from /etc/ssh/sshd_config (or the file specified with -f on
     the command line).  The file contains keyword-argument pairs, one per line.  For each key‐
     word, the first obtained value will be used.  Lines starting with ‘#’ and empty lines are
     interpreted as comments.  Arguments may optionally be enclosed in double quotes (") in order
     to represent arguments containing spaces.
     
     The possible keywords and their meanings are as follows (note that keywords are case-insensi‐
     tive and arguments are case-sensitive):


     PermitRootLogin
             Specifies whether root can log in using ssh(1).  The argument must be yes,
             prohibit-password, forced-commands-only, or no.  The default is prohibit-password.

             If this option is set to prohibit-password (or its deprecated alias,
             without-password), password and keyboard-interactive authentication are disabled for
             root.

             If this option is set to forced-commands-only, root login with public key authentica‐
             tion will be allowed, but only if the command option has been specified (which may be
             useful for taking remote backups even if root login is normally not allowed).  All
             other authentication methods are disabled for root.

             If this option is set to no, root is not allowed to log in.

FILES
     /etc/ssh/sshd_config
             Contains configuration data for sshd(8).  This file should be writable by root only,
             but it is recommended (though not necessary) that it be world-readable.



SSH_CONFIG(5)                         BSD File Formats Manual                        SSH_CONFIG(5)

NAME
     ssh_config — OpenSSH SSH client configuration files

DESCRIPTION
     ssh(1) obtains configuration data from the following sources in the following order:

           1.   command-line options
           2.   user's configuration file (~/.ssh/config)
           3.   system-wide configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config)



How to switch to the alternative port

1. update config

$ vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config


# If you want to change the port on a SELinux system, you have to tell
# SELinux about this change.
# semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp #PORTNUMBER
#
#Port 22
#AddressFamily any
#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
#ListenAddress ::


Reference

     Port    Specifies the port number that sshd(8) listens on.  The default is 22.  Multiple
             options of this type are permitted.  See also ListenAddress.

2. update Selinux port context label


To add a label to the port, if it was not occupied by other service
$ semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp #PORTNUMBER

If the port was used by other service, use the following option to modify it
$ semanage port -m  -t ssh_port_t -p tcp #PORTNUMBER

Reference

--add -t TYPE -p PROTOCOL -r RANGE port_name
--modify -t TYPE -p PROTOCOL -r RANGE port_name
-l, --list

semanage-port(8)                                                                  semanage-port(8)

NAME
       semanage-port - SELinux Policy Management port mapping tool

SYNOPSIS
       semanage  port  [-h]  [-n] [-N] [-S STORE] [ --add -t TYPE -p PROTOCOL -r RANGE port_name |
       port_range | --delete -p PROTOCOL port_name | port_range | --deleteall | --extract | --list
       [-C] | --modify -t TYPE -p PROTOCOL -r RANGE port_name | port_range ]

DESCRIPTION
       semanage  is used to configure certain elements of SELinux policy without requiring modifi‐
       cation to or recompilation from policy sources.  semanage port controls the port number  to
       port type definitions.

       -l, --list
              List records of the specified object type

3. update firewall

$ firewall-cmd --add-port=2022/tcp
$ firewall-cmd --add-port=2022/tcp --permanent


4. restart sshd


How to limit the access to only the specified users

1. update config


$ vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

AllowUsers user


     AllowUsers
             This keyword can be followed by a list of user name patterns, separated by spaces.
             If specified, login is allowed only for user names that match one of the patterns.
             Only user names are valid; a numerical user ID is not recognized.  By default, login
             is allowed for all users.  If the pattern takes the form USER@HOST then USER and HOST
             are separately checked, restricting logins to particular users from particular hosts.
             HOST criteria may additionally contain addresses to match in CIDR address/masklen
             format.  The allow/deny directives are processed in the following order: DenyUsers,
             AllowUsers, DenyGroups, and finally AllowGroups.

             See PATTERNS in ssh_config(5) for more information on patterns.

2. restart sshd
