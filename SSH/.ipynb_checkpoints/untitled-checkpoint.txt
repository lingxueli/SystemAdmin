scp

NAME
     scp — secure copy (remote file copy program)

SYNOPSIS
     scp [-346BCpqrTv] [-c cipher] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file] [-J destination] [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-S program] source
         ... target

     The source and target may be specified as a local pathname, a remote host with optional path in the form [user@]host:[path], or a URI in the
     form scp://[user@]host[:port][/path].  Local file names can be made explicit using absolute or relative pathnames to avoid scp treating file
     names containing ‘:’ as host specifiers.


     -r      Recursively copy entire directories.  Note that scp follows symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal.
     -P port
             Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.  Note that this option is written with a capital ‘P’, because -p is already
             reserved for preserving the times and modes of the file.
