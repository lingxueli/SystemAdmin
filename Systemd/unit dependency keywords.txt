$ man systemctl
       list-dependencies [UNIT]
           Shows units required and wanted by the specified unit. This recursively lists units following the Requires=,
           Requisite=, ConsistsOf=, Wants=, BindsTo= dependencies. If no unit is specified, default.target is implied.

           By default, only target units are recursively expanded. When --all is passed, all other units are
           recursively expanded as well.

           Options --reverse, --after, --before may be used to change what types of dependencies are shown.



Requires=, Requisite=, ConsistsOf=, Wants=, BindsTo= 
After Before


       Before=, After=           ### it determines the order to start up/shut down the units
       Requires=               ### it determins the dependencies with no requirement of the ordering of the start-ups
                               ### /.requires directory is created
       Wants=                 ### it determines desired dependencies - if missing, there's no impact on its integrity. 
                              ### it doesn't specify the ordering.
                              ### /.wants directory is created
       Requisite=          # a stronger version of Requires
                           # similar to After=
                           #   However, if the units listed here are not started already, they will not be started
           and the starting of this unit will fail immediately.
