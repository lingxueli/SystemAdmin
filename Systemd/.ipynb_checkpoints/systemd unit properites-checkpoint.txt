$ man systemctl

show [PATTERN...|JOB...]
           Show properties of one or more units, jobs, or the manager itself. If no argument is specified, properties
           of the manager will be shown. If a unit name is specified, properties of the unit are shown, and if a job ID
           is specified, properties of the job are shown. By default, empty properties are suppressed. Use --all to
           show those too. To select specific properties to show, use --property=. This command is intended to be used
           whenever computer-parsable output is required. Use status if you are looking for formatted human-readable
           output.

1. edit the unit config file
$ systemctl edit

It's recommended to use systemctl to edit these properties, so that the changes are written to the unit config file properly
the changes would be written in the custom config file under /etc/systemd/system/...


2. Reload systemd unit config
$ systemctl daemon-reload

$ man systemctl
       reload PATTERN...
           Asks all units listed on the command line to reload their configuration. Note that this will reload the
           service-specific configuration, not the unit configuration file of systemd. If you want systemd to reload
           the configuration file of a unit, use the daemon-reload command. In other words: for the example case of
           Apache, this will reload Apache's httpd.conf in the web server, not the apache.service systemd unit file.

           This command should not be confused with the daemon-reload command.
       daemon-reload
           Reload the systemd manager configuration. This will rerun all generators (see systemd.generator(7)), reload
           all unit files, and recreate the entire dependency tree. While the daemon is being reloaded, all sockets
           systemd listens on behalf of user configuration will stay accessible.

           This command should not be confused with the reload command.
