install bash-completion package and use Tab on the systemctl command, you don't need to remember everything here.

Example 1:
yum -y install vsftpd 		i.e. Very Secure FTP service

systemctl start vsftpd		

systemctl status vsftpd
	
	output:
        loaded: disabled; vendor preset: disabled

        disabled 	service will not be activated on a system restart
        vendor preset, disabled		by default after installation, it's dsiabled

systemctl enable vsftpd

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Systemd status from "systemctl status servicename"

	Loaded				unit file is processed and the unit is active

	Active(running)		
	Active(exited)		one-time run finished
	Active(waiting)		waiting for an event
	Inactive(dead)

	Enabled				system restart behavior
	Disabled

	Static				this unit cannot be enabled. But it's possible to be started by another unit AUTOMATICALLY.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manage Unit files

	systemctl --type=service					show active service unites
	systemctl list-units --type=service 		same
	systemctl list-units --type=service --all	show inactive and active service units
	systemctl --failed --type=service 			show all services that have failed
	systemctl status -l your.service 			show detailed status info about your.service

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manage Dependencies
	Unit types such as socket and path are directly related to a service unit. access them will automatically trigger service unit.

	Dependencies can be defined by keyword: Required, Requisit, Wants, After, Before.

	systemctl list-dependencies vsftpd					find out which dependencies this unit has
	systemctl list-dependencies --reverse vsftpd 		find out which units are dependents of this unit

	Required: "a requires b" means 1. to load a, b must be loaded. 2. if b is deactivated, so will be a
	Requisite: "a's requisite is b" means if b is not loaded, a will fail
	Wants: "a wants b" means just that, but when b is not loaded, a will not fail.
	Before: a start before b
	After: a start after b
    
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manage unit options

	systemctl show sshd 		show all systemd options that can be configured in sshd.service unit
	
	when change option, you need to write to /etc/systemd/system

	To do this, you can either:

	1. use systemctl edit httpd.service to change the default configuration

		it will create a file and directroy: /etc/systemd/system/sshd.service.d/override.conf
		This file will overwrite the default config in /usr/lib/systemd/system

		workflow:
			yum install httpd
			systemctl cat httpd.service		show current config of unit file
			systemctl show httpd.service	show available config of unit file
			systemctl edit httpd.service	write to /etc/systemd/system/httpd.service.d/override.conf, this file is appended to the default config
			systemctl cat httpd.service 	you see default config + custom config, where custom overwrites the default config
			systemctl daemon-reload			reload systemd to pick up the new configuration(reload: process the unit files) 
			systemctl restart httpd			restart the service
			systemctl status httpd			verify it's active	
	or:
	2. copy /usr/lib/systemd/system to /etc/systemd/system/, then make change
