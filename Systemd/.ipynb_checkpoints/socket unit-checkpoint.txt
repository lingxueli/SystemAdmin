NAME
       systemd.socket - Socket unit configuration

SYNOPSIS
       socket.socket

DESCRIPTION
       A unit configuration file whose name ends in ".socket" encodes information about an IPC or network socket or a file system FIFO controlled and supervised by systemd, for socket-based activation.

       ListenStream=, ListenDatagram=, ListenSequentialPacket=
           Specifies an address to listen on for a stream (SOCK_STREAM), datagram (SOCK_DGRAM), or sequential packet (SOCK_SEQPACKET) socket, respectively. The address can be written in various formats:

           If the address string is a single number, it is read as port number to listen on via IPv6. Depending on the value of BindIPv6Only= (see below) this might result in the service being available via both IPv6 and IPv4 (default) or just via IPv6.


       ExecStartPre=, ExecStartPost=
           Takes one or more command lines, which are executed before or after the listening sockets/FIFOs are created and bound, respectively.
           The first token of the command line must be an absolute filename, then followed by arguments for the process. Multiple command lines may be specified following the same scheme as used for ExecStartPre= of service unit files.

ExecStopPre=, ExecStopPost=
           Additional commands that are executed before or after the listening sockets/FIFOs are closed and removed, respectively. Multiple command lines may be specified following the same scheme as used for ExecStartPre= of service unit files.
