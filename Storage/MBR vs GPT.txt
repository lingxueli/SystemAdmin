Why use partitions

	Distinguish between different types of data, you can create backup strategy which treats each partitions differently
	Avoid single point of failure(e.g. accidentally filled up on one partition)
	Enhance security or performance from mounting options

MBR partions(Master Boot Record)
    It works with BIOS(Basic Input Output System).
    
    load BIOS to access hardware
    BIOS read the bootable device
    MBR is located on bootable device. It contains the OS boot loader and partition table.
    
    1 sector = 512 bytes
    1 KiB = 1024 bytes
    

    One of the partion is made active, the boot loader will read the code in the first sector of that partion. That code would load the rest of the OS.

    MBR has size limit. one partition <= 2TiB
    Only up to 4 primary partions is allowed. 
    Or up to 15 partitions. To do this, you can create one partion as an extended partition. Multip logical partition can be created in extended partion. Other praritions are primary partions. 
    3 primary paritions + 1 extended partition (which contains up to 12 logical partitions)
    
    
GPT partions(GUID partition table)
    GUID stands for global unique ID.It uses a 128-bit GUID to identify parition.
    
    It works with both BIOS and UEFI(Unified Extensible Firmware Interface).
    
    
    Size limit:
    One partition <= 8 Zib               Kb < MB < GB < TB < PB < EB < ZB < YB
    up to 128 partitions
    
    Backup of the parition table exists by default at the end of the disk.
