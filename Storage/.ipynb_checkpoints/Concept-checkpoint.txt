Why use partitions

	Distinguish between different types of data, you can create backup strategy which treats each partitions differently
	Avoid single point of failure(e.g. accidentally filled up on one partition)
	Enhance security or performance from mounting options

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MBR partions(Master Boot Record)
	It was invented first. Works with BIOS(Basic Input Output System). BIOS reads from the bootable device, on this bootable device, MBR was set. To boot the system, you'll need boot loader + a partition table. MBR contains both.

	One of the partion is made active, the boot loader will read the code in the first sector of that partion. That code would load the rest of the OS.

	MBR has size limit. 2TiB
	Partioin limt. Only up to 4 partions is allowed. 
	Or up to 15 partitions. To do this, you can create one partion as an extended partition. Multip logical partition can be created in extended partion. Other praritions are primary partions.  

	Make sure you understand primary partions, extended partition, logical partition.
