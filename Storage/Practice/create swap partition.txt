NAME
       mkswap - set up a Linux swap area

SYNOPSIS
       mkswap [options] device [size]

DESCRIPTION
       mkswap sets up a Linux swap area on a device or in a file.

NAME
       free - Display amount of free and used memory in the system

SYNOPSIS
       free [options]

DESCRIPTION
       free  displays  the total amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the system, as well as
       the buffers and caches used by the kernel. The information is gathered by parsing /proc/meminfo. The
       displayed columns are:

       total  Total installed memory (MemTotal and SwapTotal in /proc/meminfo)

       used   Used memory (calculated as total - free - buffers - cache)

       free   Unused memory (MemFree and SwapFree in /proc/meminfo)

       shared Memory used (mostly) by tmpfs (Shmem in /proc/meminfo)

       buffers
              Memory used by kernel buffers (Buffers in /proc/meminfo)

       cache  Memory used by the page cache and slabs (Cached and SReclaimable in /proc/meminfo)

       buff/cache
              Sum of buffers and cache
              
       available
              Estimation  of  how much memory is available for starting new applications, without swapping.
              Unlike the data provided by the cache or free fields, this  field  takes  into  account  page
              cache  and also that not all reclaimable memory slabs will be reclaimed due to items being in
              use (MemAvailable in /proc/meminfo, available on kernels 3.14, emulated on  kernels  2.6.27+,
              otherwise the same as free)
              
       -m, --mebi
              Display the amount of memory in mebibytes.

SWAPON(8)                                  System Administration                                  SWAPON(8)

NAME
       swapon, swapoff - enable/disable devices and files for paging and swapping

SYNOPSIS
       swapon [options] [specialfile...]
       swapoff [-va] [specialfile...]

DESCRIPTION
       swapon is used to specify devices on which paging and swapping are to take place.

       The device or file used is given by the specialfile parameter.  It may be of the form -L label or -U
       uuid to indicate a device by label or uuid.

       Calls to swapon normally occur in the system boot scripts making all swap devices available, so that
       the paging and swapping activity is interleaved across several devices and files.

       swapoff  disables  swapping on the specified devices and files.  When the -a flag is given, swapping
       is disabled on all known swap devices and files (as found in /proc/swaps or /etc/fstab).

Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 8300): 8200
Changed type of partition to 'Linux swap'

Command (? for help): w

Final checks complete. About to write GPT data. THIS WILL OVERWRITE EXISTING
