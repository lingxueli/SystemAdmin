MOUNT(8)                                   System Administration                                   MOUNT(8)

NAME
       mount - mount a filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       mount [-l|-h|-V]

       mount -a [-fFnrsvw] [-t fstype] [-O optlist]

       mount [-fnrsvw] [-o options] device|dir

       mount [-fnrsvw] [-t fstype] [-o options] device dir

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       The full set of mount options used by an invocation of mount is determined by first  extracting  the
       mount options for the filesystem from the fstab table, then applying any options specified by the -o
       argument, and finally applying a -r or -w option, when present.

NAME
       fstab - static information about the filesystems

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/fstab

DESCRIPTION

              This field describes the mount options associated with the filesystem.

              It is formatted as a comma-separated list of options.  It contains at least the type of mount
              (ro or rw), plus any additional options appropriate to the filesystem type (including perfor‚Äê
              mance-tuning options).  For details, see mount(8) or swapon(8).

              Basic filesystem-independent options are:

              defaults
                     use default options: rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async.

              noauto do not mount when "mount -a" is given (e.g., at boot time)

              user   allow a user to mount

              owner  allow device owner to mount

              comment
                     or x-<name> for use by fstab-maintaining programs

              nofail do not report errors for this device if it does not exist.



   Mount options for reiserfs
       Reiserfs is a journaling filesystem.

       user_xattr
              Enable Extended User Attributes.  See the attr(5) manual page.

       acl    Enable POSIX Access Control Lists.  See the acl(5) manual page.

FILESYSTEM-INDEPENDENT MOUNT OPTIONS
       Some of these options are only useful when they appear in the /etc/fstab file.

       ro     Mount the filesystem read-only.

       rw     Mount the filesystem read-write.
    
        ### enable/disable access time modification
       atime  Do  not  use  the noatime feature, so the inode access time is controlled by kernel defaults.
              See also the descriptions of the relatime and strictatime mount options.

       noatime
              Do not update inode access times on this filesystem (e.g. for faster access on the news spool
              to  speed  up news servers).  This works for all inode types (directories too), so it implies
              nodiratime.
              
        ### allow/disallow execution of program files
       exec   Permit execution of binaries.

       noexec Do not permit direct execution of any binaries on the mounted filesystem.

        ### to mount a network file system
       _netdev
              The filesystem resides on a device that requires network access (used to prevent  the  system
              from attempting to mount these filesystems until the network has been enabled on the system).
