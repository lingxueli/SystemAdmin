User download the key and store it locally. - This is the first step in yum install.

Later security is checked every time a package is downloaded from the repository.

Path to the GPG key:

[root@localhost yum.repos.d]# cat CentOS-Linux-BaseOS.repo 
# CentOS-Linux-BaseOS.repo
#
# The mirrorlist system uses the connecting IP address of the client and the
# update status of each mirror to pick current mirrors that are geographically
# close to the client.  You should use this for CentOS updates unless you are
# manually picking other mirrors.
#
# If the mirrorlist does not work for you, you can try the commented out
# baseurl line instead.
