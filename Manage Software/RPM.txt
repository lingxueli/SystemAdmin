Reasons not to use rpm to install packages: lack of support for dependencies; only RPM database is synced after install, yum database is unsynced.

It's still useful to query the packages.


RPM package name:

autof-5.0.7-40.el7.x86_64.rmp

package name - package version + subversion - Red Hat version - platform

   QUERY OPTIONS
       The general form of an rpm query command is

       rpm {-q|--query} [select-options] [query-options]

       You may specify the format that package information should be printed in. To do this, you use the

        --qf|--queryformat QUERYFMT

       option, followed by the QUERYFMT format string.  Query formats are modified versions of the standard printf(3) formatting. The for‐
       mat is made up of static strings (which may include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs, and other special  characters)
       and printf(3) type formatters.  As rpm already knows the type to print, the type specifier must be omitted however, and replaced by
       the name of the header tag to be printed, enclosed by {} characters. Tag names are case insensitive, and the leading  RPMTAG_  por‐
       tion of the tag name may be omitted as well.

       Alternate output formats may be requested by following the tag with :typetag.  Currently, the following types are supported:

       There are two subsets of options for querying: package selection, and information selection.

   PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS:
       PACKAGE_NAME
              Query  installed  package  named PACKAGE_NAME. To specify the package more precisely the package name may be followed by the
              version or version and release both separated by a dash or an architecture name separated by a dot. See the  output  of  rpm
              -qa or rpm -qp PACKAGE_FILE as an example.

       -a, --all [SELECTOR]
              Query all installed packages.

              An  optional  SELECTOR  in  the  form of tag=pattern can be provided to narrow the selection, for example name="b*" to query
              packages whose name starts with "b".

       --dupes
              List duplicated packages.

       -f, --file FILE
              Query package owning FILE.
              
       -p, --package PACKAGE_FILE
              Query an (uninstalled) package PACKAGE_FILE.  The PACKAGE_FILE may be specified as an ftp or http style URL, in  which  case
              the  package  header  will  be  downloaded and queried.  See FTP/HTTP OPTIONS for information on rpm's internal ftp and http
              client support. The PACKAGE_FILE argument(s), if not a binary package, will be interpreted  as  an  ASCII  package  manifest
              unless  --nomanifest  option is used.  In manifests, comments are permitted, starting with a '#', and each line of a package
              manifest file may include white space separated glob expressions, including URL's, that will be expanded to paths  that  are
              substituted in place of the package manifest as additional PACKAGE_FILE arguments to the query.

   PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS:
       -d, --artifactfiles
              List only artifact files (implies -l).
              Display change information for the package with full time stamps.

       -c, --configfiles
              List only configuration files (implies -l).

       -d, --docfiles
              List only documentation files (implies -l).

       --dump Dump file information as follows (implies -l):

              path size mtime digest mode owner group isconfig isdoc rdev symlink

       -i, --info
              Display package information, including name, version, and description.  This uses the --queryformat if one was specified.

       --last Orders the package listing by install time such that the latest packages are at the top.

       -l, --list
              List files in package.

       --provides
              List capabilities this package provides.
              
       --recommends
              List capabilities recommended by package(s)

       -R, --requires
              List capabilities on which this package depends.

       --suggests
              List capabilities suggested by package(s)

       --supplements
              List capabilities supplemented by package(s)

       --scripts
              List the package specific scriptlet(s) that are used as part of the installation and uninstallation processes.

       -s, --state
              Display  the  states  of  files  in  the  package  (implies -l).  The state of each file is one of normal, not installed, or
              replaced.

       --triggers, --triggerscripts
              Display the trigger scripts, if any, which are contained in the package.

       --noartifact
              Don't display artifact files.  --noghost Don't display ghost files. Useful in combination with option --list.
              
       --noconfig
              Don't display config files.

       --xml  Format package headers as XML.

Summary     : Network exploration tool and security scanner
Description :
Nmap is a utility for network exploration or security auditing.  It supports
ping scanning (determine which hosts are up), many port scanning techniques
(determine what services the hosts are offering), and TCP/IP fingerprinting
(remote host operating system identification). Nmap also offers flexible target
and port specification, decoy scanning, determination of TCP sequence
predictability characteristics, reverse-identd scanning, and more. In addition
to the classic command-line nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes a flexible
data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (netcat utility ncat), a utility
for comparing scan results (ndiff), and a packet generation and response
analysis tool (nping).
