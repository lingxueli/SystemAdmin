A software could have multiple versions. One version is a module stream.

A software could have multiple profiles. One profile is for a use case. e.g. minimal profile, default profile, server profile.

   Module Command
       Modularity  overview  is  available at man page dnf.modularity(7).  Module subcommands take <module-spec>... arguments that specify
       modules or profiles.

       dnf [options] module install <module-spec>...
              Install module profiles, including their packages.  In case no profile was provided, all  default  profiles  get  installed.
              Module streams get enabled accordingly.

              This  command cannot be used for switching module streams. It is recommended to remove all installed content from the module
              and reset the module using the reset command. After you reset the module, you can install the other stream.

       dnf [options] module update <module-spec>...
              Update packages associated with an active module stream, optionally restricted to a profile.  If the  profile_name  is  pro‚Äê
              vided, only the packages referenced by that profile will be updated.

       dnf [options] module remove <module-spec>...
              Remove  installed  module  profiles,  including  packages  that were installed with the dnf module install command. Will not
              remove packages required by other installed module profiles or by other user-installed packages.  In  case  no  profile  was
              provided, all installed profiles get removed.

       dnf [options] module remove --all <module-spec>...
              Remove  installed  module  profiles, including packages that were installed with the dnf module install command.  With --all
              option it additionally removes all packages whose names are provided  by  specified  modules.  Packages  required  by  other
              installed module profiles and packages whose names are also provided by any other module are not removed.

       dnf [options] module enable <module-spec>...
              Enable a module stream and make the stream RPMs available in the package set.

              Modular  dependencies  are  resolved, dependencies checked and also recursively enabled. In case of modular dependency issue
              the operation will be rejected. To perform the action anyway please use --skip-broken option.

              This command cannot be used for switching module streams. It is recommended to remove all installed content from the module,
              and reset the module using the reset command. After you reset the module, you can enable the other stream.

       dnf [options] module disable <module-name>...
              Disable  a module. All related module streams will become unavailable.  Consequently, all installed profiles will be removed
              and the module RPMs will become unavailable in the package set. In case of modular dependency issue the  operation  will  be
              rejected. To perform the action anyway please use --skip-broken option.

       dnf [options] module reset <module-name>...
              Reset  module  state  so  it's no longer enabled or disabled.  Consequently, all installed profiles will be removed and only
              RPMs from the default stream will be available in the package set.

       dnf [options] module provides <package-name-spec>...
              Lists all modular packages matching <package-name-spec> from all modules (including disabled), along with  the  modules  and
              streams they belong to.

       dnf [options] module list [--all] [module_name...]
              Lists all module streams, their profiles and states (enabled, disabled, default).

       dnf [options] module list --enabled [module_name...]
              Lists module streams that are enabled.

       dnf [options] module list --disabled [module_name...]
              Lists module streams that are disabled.

       dnf [options] module list --installed [module_name...]
              List module streams with installed profiles.

       dnf [options] module info <module-spec>...
              Print detailed information about given module stream.

       dnf [options] module info --profile <module-spec>...
              Print detailed information about given module profiles.

       dnf [options] module repoquery <module-spec>...
              List all available packages belonging to selected modules.

       dnf [options] module repoquery --available <module-spec>...
              List all available packages belonging to selected modules.

       dnf [options] module repoquery --installed <module-spec>...
              List all installed packages with same name like packages belonging to selected modules.
