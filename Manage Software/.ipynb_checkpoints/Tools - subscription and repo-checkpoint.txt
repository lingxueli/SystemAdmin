NAME
       subscription-manager  -  Registers  systems  to  a subscription management service and then
       attaches and manages subscriptions for software products.

SYNOPSIS
       subscription-manager command [options]

       Subscription Manager performs several key operations:

              * It registers systems to the Red Hat subscription management service and  adds  the
              system  to  the inventory. Once a system is registered, it can receive updates based
              on its subscriptions to any kind of software products.

              * It lists both available and used subscriptions.

              * It allows administrators to both attach specific subscriptions  to  a  system  and
              remove those subscriptions.


COMMANDS AND OPTIONS
       subscription-manager has specific options available for each  command,  depending  on  what
       operation  is  being  performed. Subscription Manager commands are related to the different
       subscription operations:

              1. register

              2. unregister

              3. attach

              4. auto-attach

              5. remove

              6. release

...

   LIST OPTIONS
       The  list  command  lists  all  of the subscriptions that are compatible with a system. The
       options allow the list to be filtered by subscriptions that  are  used  by  the  system  or
       unused subscriptions that are available to the system.

       --afterdate=YYYY-MM-DD
              Shows  pools  that are active on or after the given date. This is only used with the
              --available option.

       --all  Lists all possible subscriptions that have been purchased, even if they don't  match
              the architecture of the system. This is used with the --available option.

       --available
              Lists available subscriptions which are not yet attached to the system.
              
       --consumed
              Lists all of the subscriptions currently attached to the system.
              

   ATTACH OPTIONS
       The attach command applies a specific subscription to the system.

       --auto Automatically  attaches the best-matched compatible subscription or subscriptions to
              the system. This is the default unless --pool or --file are used.

# if you are using CentOs, you get access to the repository and no registeration is required.
