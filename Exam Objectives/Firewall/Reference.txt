FIREWALL-CMD(1)                  firewall-cmd                  FIREWALL-CMD(1)

NAME
       firewall-cmd - firewalld command line client

SYNOPSIS
       firewall-cmd [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
       firewall-cmd is the command line client of the firewalld daemon. It
       provides interface to manage runtime and permanent configuration.

       The runtime configuration in firewalld is separated from the permanent
       configuration. This means that things can get changed in the runtime or
       permanent configuration.
       
   Status Options

       --reload
           Reload firewall rules and keep state information. Current permanent
           configuration will become new runtime configuration, i.e. all
           runtime only changes done until reload are lost with reload if they
           have not been also in permanent configuration.

           Note: Runtime changes applied via the direct interface are not
           affected and will therefore stay in place until firewalld daemon is
           restarted completely.


   Permanent Options
       --permanent
           The permanent option --permanent can be used to set options
           permanently. These changes are not effective immediately, only
           after service restart/reload or system reboot. Without the
           --permanent option, a change will only be part of the runtime
           configuration.

           If you want to make a change in runtime and permanent
           configuration, use the same call with and without the --permanent
           option.

           The --permanent option can be optionally added to all options
           further down where it is supported.


   Zone Options
       --get-default-zone
           Print default zone for connections and interfaces.

       --set-default-zone=zone
           Set default zone for connections and interfaces where no zone has
           been selected. Setting the default zone changes the zone for the
           connections or interfaces, that are using the default zone.

           This is a runtime and permanent change.

       [--permanent] --get-zones
           Print predefined zones as a space separated list.

       [--permanent] --get-services
           Print predefined services as a space separated list.

   Options to Adapt and Query Zones
       Options in this section affect only one particular zone. If used with
       --zone=zone option, they affect the zone zone. If the option is
       omitted, they affect default zone (see --get-default-zone).

       [--permanent] [--zone=zone] --list-all
           List everything added for or enabled in zone. If zone is omitted,
           default zone will be used.

       [--permanent] [--zone=zone] --list-services
           List services added for zone as a space separated list. If zone is
           omitted, default zone will be used.

       [--permanent] [--zone=zone] --add-service=service [--timeout=timeval]
           Add a service for zone. If zone is omitted, default zone will be
           used. This option can be specified multiple times. If a timeout is
           supplied, the rule will be active for the specified amount of time
           and will be removed automatically afterwards.  timeval is either a
           number (of seconds) or number followed by one of characters s
           (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), for example 20m or 1h.
           The service is one of the firewalld provided services. To get a
           list of the supported services, use firewall-cmd --get-services.

           The --timeout option is not combinable with the --permanent option.

       [--permanent] [--zone=zone] --remove-service=service
           Remove a service from zone. This option can be specified multiple
           times. If zone is omitted, default zone will be used.

       [--permanent] [--zone=zone] --add-port=portid[-portid]/protocol
       [--timeout=timeval]
           Add the port for zone. If zone is omitted, default zone will be
           used. This option can be specified multiple times. If a timeout is
           supplied, the rule will be active for the specified amount of time
           and will be removed automatically afterwards.  timeval is either a
           number (of seconds) or number followed by one of characters s
           (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), for example 20m or 1h.

           The port can either be a single port number or a port range
           portid-portid. The protocol can either be tcp, udp, sctp or dccp.

           The --timeout option is not combinable with the --permanent option.

       [--permanent] [--zone=zone] --remove-port=portid[-portid]/protocol
           Remove the port from zone. If zone is omitted, default zone will be
           used. This option can be specified multiple times.
           
           
$ man firewalld
CONCEPTS
       firewalld has a D-Bus interface for firewall configuration of services
       and applications. It also has a command line client for the user.
       Services or applications already using D-Bus can request changes to the
       firewall with the D-Bus interface directly. For more information on the
       firewalld D-Bus interface, please have a look at firewalld.dbus(5).

       firewalld provides support for zones, predefined services and ICMP
       types and has a separation of runtime and permanent configuration
       options. Permanent configuration is loaded from XML files in
       /usr/lib/firewalld (--default-config) or /etc/firewalld
       (--system-config) (see the section called “DIRECTORIES”).



DIRECTORIES
       firewalld supports two configuration directories:

   Default/Fallback configuration in /usr/lib/firewalld (--default-config)
       This directory contains the default and fallback configuration provided
       by firewalld for icmptypes, services and zones. The files provided with
       the firewalld package should not get changed and the changes are gone
       with an update of the firewalld package. Additional icmptypes, services
       and zones can be provided with packages or by creating files.

   System configuration settings in /etc/firewalld (--system-config)
       The system or user configuration stored here is either created by the
       system administrator or by customization with the configuration
       interface of firewalld or by hand. The files will overload the default
       configuration files.
