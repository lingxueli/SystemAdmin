info page is useful when the command's main document is not in man page.
Use info or pinfo to read the page. pinfo is easier because it provides menu items.

Example:
[root@localhost lisa]# man ls

       Full documentation at: <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/ls>
       or available locally via: info '(coreutils) ls invocation'


This indicates the full document is at info page instead of man page.


Info page is organized like web pages. The first line of info page is the navigation. It gives you the current position in the doc.
Each item starts with asterisk(*) is a menu item. Use the arrow key + enter to select an item this brings you down one level. To get back up again, type u.

    10.1.2 What information is listed
    ---------------------------------

    These options affect the information that ‘ls’ displays.  By default,
    only file names are shown.

    ‘--author’
         List each file’s author when producing long format directory
         listings.  In GNU/Hurd, file authors can differ from their owners,
         but in other operating systems the two are the same.

5 Selecting a Node
******************

This section details the numerous Info commands which select a new node
to view in the current window.


  The most basic node commands are 'n', 'p', 'u', and 'l'.

   When you are viewing a node, the top line of the node contains some
Info "pointers" which describe where the next, previous, and up nodes
are.  Info uses this line to move about the node structure of the file
when you use the following commands:

'n' ('next-node')
'C-<NEXT>' (on DOS/Windows only)
     Select the 'Next' node.

     The <NEXT> key is known as the <PgDn> key on some keyboards.

'p' ('prev-node')
'C-<PREVIOUS>' (on DOS/Windows only)
     Select the 'Prev' node.

     The <PREVIOUS> key is known as the <PgUp> key on some keyboards.

'u' ('up-node')
'C-<UP>' (an arrow key on DOS/Windows only)
     Select the 'Up' node.
