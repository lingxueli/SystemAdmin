    :wq save and quit
    :q! quit
    :w filename: save as "filename"

    dd delete the current line
    yy copy the current line
    p paste the current selection
    v enter visual mode, where you could select a block of text using arrow kyes. Later you could use d to cut the selection or y to copy it, p to paste it
    u undo the last command
    Ctrl-r redo the last command

NAME
       yum-utils - classic YUM utilities implemented as CLI shims on top of DNF

       The main purpose of these shims is ensuring backward compatibility with yum-3.

       repoquery
              Searches  the  available  DNF  repositories  for selected packages and displays the requested information
              about them.  Part of core DNF functionality.  Maps to dnf repoquery.  See Repoquery Command in dnf(8) for
              details.

SYNOPSIS
       dnf [options] <command> [<args>...]



   Repoquery Command
       dnf [options] repoquery [<select-options>] [<query-options>] [<package-file-spec>]
              Searches  available  DNF  repositories for selected packages and displays the requested information about
              them. It is an equivalent of rpm -q for remote repositories.

       dnf [options] repoquery --querytags
              Provides the list of tags recognized by the --queryformat repoquery option.

              There are also a few specific repoquery commands repoquery-n, repoquery-na and repoquery-nevra that allow
              the  specification  of  an  exact argument in the NEVRA format (does not affect arguments of options like
              --whatprovides <arg>, ...).
