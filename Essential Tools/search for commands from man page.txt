the most important part of a man page is in the bottom: "examples" and "see also". "see also" is usedful when you don't hit the right man page but it gives you the relevant pages.

To search the man page:

$ man -k  keyword
$ apropos keyword

They can search the mandb database and looks in the summary of all man pages for keyword.

$ man man
       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short  manual  page  descrip‐
              tions  for keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1) for
              details.

man page sections
The most relevant sections for system administration man page:
    1: executable programs or shell commands
    5: file formats and conventions
    8: system administration commands


For example, this returns the configuration file that has something to do with password:

[lisa@localhost ~]$ man -k password | grep 5
login.defs (5)       - shadow password suite configuration
passwd (5)           - password file
password-auth (5)    - Common configuration file for PAMified services
shadow (5)           - shadowed password file
smbpasswd (5)        - The Samba encrypted password file

As another example, this returns the administrator command for partition
[lisa@localhost ~]$ man -k partition | grep 8
sgdisk (8)           - Command-line GUID partition table (GPT) manipulator for Linux and Unix
addpart (8)          - tell the kernel about the existence of a partition
cfdisk (8)           - display or manipulate a disk partition table
cgdisk (8)           - Curses-based GUID partition table (GPT) manipulator
delpart (8)          - tell the kernel to forget about a partition
fdisk (8)            - manipulate disk partition table
fixparts (8)         - MBR partition table repair utility
gdisk (8)            - Interactive GUID partition table (GPT) manipulator
kpartx (8)           - Create device maps from partition tables.
parted (8)           - a partition manipulation program
partprobe (8)        - inform the OS of partition table changes
partx (8)            - tell the kernel about the presence and numbering of on-disk partitions
resizepart (8)       - tell the kernel about the new size of a partition

NAME
       passwd - password file

DESCRIPTION
       The /etc/passwd file is a text file that describes user login accounts for the system.  It should have read permission allowed for all users (many utili‐
       ties, like ls(1) use it to map user IDs to usernames), but write access only for the superuser.
       
       The field are as follows:

       name        This is the user's login name.  It should not contain capital letters.

       password    This is either the encrypted user password, an asterisk (*), or the letter 'x'.  (See pwconv(8) for an explanation of 'x'.)

NAME
       mandb - create or update the manual page index caches

SYNOPSIS
       mandb [-dqsucpt?V] [-C file] [manpath]
       mandb [-dqsut] [-C file] -f filename ...

DESCRIPTION
       mandb  is  used  to initialise or manually update index database caches that are usually maintained by man.  The
       caches contain information relevant to the current state of the manual page system and  the  information  stored
       within them is used by the man-db utilities to enhance their speed and functionality.
