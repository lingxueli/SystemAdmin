   Pipelines
       A  pipeline  is  a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of
       the control operators | or |&.  The format for a pipeline is:

              [time [-p]] [ ! ] command [ [|⎪|&] command2 ... ]

       The standard output of command is connected via a pipe to the  standard
       input  of  command2.   This connection is performed before any redirec‐
       tions specified by the command (see REDIRECTION below).  If |& is used,
       command's  standard  error, in addition to its standard output, is con‐
       nected to command2's standard input through the pipe; it  is  shorthand
       for  2>&1  |.   This  implicit redirection of the standard error to the
       standard output is performed after any redirections  specified  by  the
       command.
