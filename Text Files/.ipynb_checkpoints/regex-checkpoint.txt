REGEX(7)                                       Linux Programmer's Manual                                       REGEX(7)

NAME
       regex - POSIX.2 regular expressions

DESCRIPTION
       Regular  expressions  ("RE"s),  as  defined  in  POSIX.2, come in two forms: modern REs (roughly those of egrep;
       POSIX.2 calls these "extended" REs) and obsolete REs (roughly those of ed(1); POSIX.2  "basic"  REs).   Obsolete
       REs  mostly  exist  for backward compatibility in some old programs; they will be discussed at the end.  POSIX.2
       leaves some aspects of RE syntax and semantics open; "(!)" marks decisions on these  aspects  that  may  not  be
       fully portable to other POSIX.2 implementations.
