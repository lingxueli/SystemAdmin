The tr command in UNIX is a command line utility for translating or deleting characters

It supports a range of transformations including uppercase to lowercase, squeezing repeating characters, deleting specific characters and basic find and replace. tr stands for translate.

Syntax :

$ tr [OPTION] SET1 [SET2]

Options

-c : complements the set of characters in string. i.e., operations apply to characters not in the given set
-d : delete characters in the first set from the output.
-s : replaces repeated characters listed in the set1 with single occurrence
