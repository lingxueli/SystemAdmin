find takes a path to find things

find /
# find (and print) every file on the system

# -name argument allows you to restrict your results to files that match the given pattern
[lisa@localhost ~]$ find ~ -name '*file*'
/home/lisa/.bash_profile
/home/lisa/file1.txt
/home/lisa/file2.txt
/home/lisa/greekfile

# What if some of them have an uppercase extension? -iname is like -name, but it is case-insensitive.
find ~ -iname '*file'

# we can combine patterns with an "or," represented by -o
find ~ ( -iname 'jpeg' -o -iname 'jpg' )

# We can modify our command with the -type argument to look only for files.
find ~ \( -iname '*jpeg' -o -iname '*jpg' \) -type f
# find directories only
find ~ \( -iname '*jpeg' -o -iname '*jpg' \) -type d

# narrow this down to files that have changed in the last week
find ~ \( -iname '*jpeg' -o -iname '*jpg' \) -type f -mtime -7

# You can do time filters based on file status change time (ctime), modification time (mtime), or access time (atime). These are in days.

# if you want finer-grained control, you can express it in minutes instead (cmin, mmin, and amin, respectively). 

# Unless you know exactly the time you want, you'll probably prefix the number with + (more than) or â€“ (less than).

[lisa@localhost ~]$ find ~ -name '*file*' -cmin -30
[lisa@localhost ~]$ find ~ -name '*file*' -cmin -40
/home/lisa/greekfile
[lisa@localhost ~]$ find ~ -name '*file*' -cmin -50
/home/lisa/greekfile
[lisa@localhost ~]$ find ~ -name '*file*' -cmin -80

# you're running out of disk space, so you want to find all the gigantic (let's define that as "greater than 1 gigabyte") files in the log directory

find /var/log -size +1G

# find all the files owned by bcotton in /data

find /data -owner bcotton

# look for files based on permissions. Perhaps you want to find all the world-readable files in your home directory to make sure you're not oversharing.

find ~ -perm -o=r

# For example `-perm g=w' will only match files
              which have mode 0020 (that is, ones for which group write
              permission is the only permission set).
