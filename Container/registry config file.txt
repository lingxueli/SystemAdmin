CONTAINERS-REGISTRIES.CONF(5)                          Aug 2017                          CONTAINERS-REGISTRIES.CONF(5)

NAME
       containers-registries.conf - Syntax of System Registry Configuration File

DESCRIPTION
       The CONTAINERS-REGISTRIES configuration file is a system-wide configuration file for container image
       registries. The file format is TOML.

       Container engines will use the $HOME/.config/containers/registries.conf if it exists, otherwise they will use
       /etc/containers/registries.conf



$ cat /etc/containers/registries.conf
# The following registries are a set of secure defaults provided by Red Hat.
# Each of these registries provides container images curated, patched
# and maintained by Red Hat and its partners
#[registries.search]
#registries = ['registry.access.redhat.com', 'registry.redhat.io']

# To ensure compatibility with docker we've included docker.io in the default search list. However Red Hat
# does not curate, patch or maintain container images from the docker.io registry.
[registries.search]
registries = ['registry.access.redhat.com', 'registry.redhat.io', 'docker.io']

# The following registries entry can be used for convenience but includes
# container images built by the community. This set of content comes with all
# of the risks of any user generated content including security and performance
# issues. To use this list first comment out the default list, then uncomment
# the following list
#[registries.search]
#registries = ['registry.access.redhat.com', 'registry.redhat.io', 'docker.io', 'quay.io']

# Registries that do not use TLS when pulling images or uses self-signed
# certificates.

# Blocked Registries, blocks the `docker daemon` from pulling from the blocked registry.  If you specify
# "*", then the docker daemon will only be allowed to pull from registries listed above in the search
# registries.  Blocked Registries is deprecated because other container runtimes and tools will not use it.
# It is recommended that you use the trust policy file /etc/containers/policy.json to control which
# registries you want to allow users to pull and push from.  policy.json gives greater flexibility, and
# supports all container runtimes and tools including the docker daemon, cri-o, buildah ...
# The atomic CLI `atomic trust` can be used to easily configure the policy.json file.

CONTAINERS-REGISTRIES.CONF.D(5)                        Mar 2020                        CONTAINERS-REGISTRIES.CONF.D(5)

NAME
       containers-registries.conf.d - directory for drop-in registries.conf files

DESCRIPTION
       CONTAINERS-REGISTRIES.CONF.D is a system-wide directory for drop-in configuration files in the
       containers-registries.conf(5) format.

       By default, the directory is located at /etc/containers/registries.conf.d.

CONFIGURATION PRECEDENCE
       Once the main configuration at /etc/containers/registries.conf is loaded, the files in
       /etc/containers/registries.conf.d are loaded in alpha-numerical order. Then the conf files in
       $HOME/.config/containers/registries.conf.d are loaded in alpha-numerical order, if they exist. If the
       $HOME/.config/containers/registries.conf is loaded, only the conf files under
       $HOME/.config/containers/registries.conf.d are loaded in alpha-numerical order.  Specified fields in a conf
       file will overwrite any previous setting.  Note that only files with the .conf prefix are loaded, other files
       and sub-directories are ignored.
