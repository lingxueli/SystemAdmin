ENV variables may be consumed by containerized applications for proper operation.

ENV variables needs to be passed to containers at the time of launching the container

$ man podman-run
   --tty, -t=true|false
       Allocate a pseudo-TTY. The default is false.

       When set to true, Podman will allocate a pseudo-tty and attach to the standard input of the container. This can
       be used, for example, to run a throwaway interactive shell. The default is false.

       NOTE: The -t option is incompatible with a redirection of the Podman client standard input.

   --interactive, -i=true|false
       When set to true, keep stdin open even if not attached. The default is false.


   --env, -e=env
       Set environment variables.

       This option allows arbitrary environment variables that are available for the process to be launched inside of
       the container. If an environment variable is specified without a value, Podman will check the host environment
       for a value and set the variable only if it is set on the host. If an environment variable ending in * is
       specified, Podman will search the host environment for variables starting with the prefix and will add those
       variables to the container. If an environment variable with a trailing ***** is specified, then a value must be
       supplied.

       See Environment ⟨#environment⟩ note below for precedence and examples.

    HISTSIZE
