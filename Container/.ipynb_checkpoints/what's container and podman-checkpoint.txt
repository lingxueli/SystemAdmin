Root container vs rootless container

Root container is launched by root user. This gives container full access to the administrative functions. However, the security is compromised if the container is misconfigured. 

Rootless container refers to the ability for an unprivileged user to create, run and manage containers without the compromise of the security. They add a new security layer; even if the container engine, runtime, or orchestrator is compromised, the attacker won’t gain root privileges on the host. With rootless containers, you can run a containerized process as any other process without needing to escalate any user’s privileges.
