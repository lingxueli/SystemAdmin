In order to install the necessary software to manage containers, you'll find the package module named "container-tools" 

1. if you're using redhat, not centos, set up the subscription and repositories to access the latest version of software packages

# register the system to the Red Hat Subscription Management service
$ subscription-manager register --username

# attach the system with the RHEL subscription
$ subscription-manager attach

# inspect the repositories used based on the subscription
$ yum repolist


# now you can access the lastest versions of the software and you're ready to install the container tools.

# example output from centos
[root@localhost ~]# yum repolist
Updating Subscription Management repositories.

NAME
       subscription-manager  -  Registers systems to a subscription management
       service and then attaches and manages subscriptions for software  prod‐
       ucts.

SYNOPSIS
       subscription-manager command [options]

DESCRIPTION
       subscription-manager is a client program that registers a system with a
       subscription management service such as the Customer  Portal  Subscrip‐
       tion Management service or on-premise Subscription Asset Manager.

       Red  Hat  provides content updates and support by issuing subscriptions
       for its products. These subscriptions are applied to  systems;  once  a
       subscription  for  a  product  is  attached to a system, that system is
       allowed to install, update, and receive support for that software prod‐
       uct.  IT  administrators need to track these subscriptions and how they
       are attached. This subscription management is a feature  available  for
       Red Hat platforms version 5.7 (and later) and version 6.1 (and later).


2. install the container tools package

# find the package module name for containers

RPM - the default package format. Containers files as well as metadata that describes how to install the package
module - In a module different versions and profiles can be provided
Application stream - a specific version of the module
Profile - a collection of packages that are installed together for a use case.

   Module Command
       Modularity overview is available at man page dnf.modularity(7).  Module
       subcommands take <module-spec>... arguments  that  specify  modules  or
       profiles.

       dnf [options] module install <module-spec>...
              Install  module  profiles, including their packages.  In case no
              profile was provided, all default profiles get installed.   Mod‐
              ule streams get enabled accordingly.

              This  command cannot be used for switching module streams. It is
              recommended to remove all installed content from the module  and
              reset  the  module  using the reset command. After you reset the
              module, you can install the other stream.

       dnf [options] module update <module-spec>...
              Update packages associated with an active module stream, option‐
              ally  restricted to a profile.  If the profile_name is provided,
              only the packages referenced by that profile will be updated.

       dnf [options] module list [--all] [module_name...]
              Lists  all  module  streams, their profiles and states (enabled,
              disabled, default).
