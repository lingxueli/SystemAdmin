# how to configure automount for NFS

1. master file /etc/auto.master defines the mapper file
2. secondary mapper file as directed by the master file defines mount

1. direct map

$ mkdir /autodir

# define mapper
$ vi /ect/auto.master
/- /ect/auto.master.d/auto.dir

# mount point: /-  
# mapper file: /ect/auto.master.d/auto.dir

# specify mount detailes in the mapper file
$ vi /ect/auto.master.d/auto.dir
/autodir server20:/common

# mount point: /autodir
# NFS path: server20:/common

# start autoFS service
$ systemctl enable --now autofs
$ systemctl status autofs

# test, command such as ls, cd in the mount point will activate the automount
$ ls /autodir
$ mount | grep autodir


2. indirect map - the local path in the mapper is not root

# define mapper
$ vi /etc/auto.master
/misc   /etc/auto.misc

# specify mount detailes in the mapper file
$ vi /etc/auto.misc
autoindir   server20:/common

# start autoFS service
$ systemctl enable --now autofs
$ systemctl status autofs

# test, command such as ls, cd in the mount point will activate the automount
$ ls /misc/autoindir
$ mount | grep autoindir


3. wildcard

# define mapper
$ vi /etc/auto.master
/nfshome   /etc/auto.master.d/auto.home

# specify mount detailes in the mapper file
$ vi /etc/auto.misc
*   -rw   server20:/home/&

Anything under server20:/home will be mounted under local path /nfshome
*: local path, anything
&: the matching item in the remote server







AUTO.MASTER(5)                          File Formats Manual                         AUTO.MASTER(5)

NAME
       auto.master - Master Map for automounter consulted by autofs

DESCRIPTION
       The  auto.master  map  is  consulted  to  set  up  automount  managed mount points when the
       autofs(8) script is invoked or the automount(8) program is run. Each line describes a mount
       point  and  refers  to  an autofs map describing file systems to be mounted under the mount
       point.

       The default location of the master map is /etc/auto.master but an  alternate  name  may  be..
       
       
EXAMPLE
         /-        auto.data
         /home     /etc/auto.home
         /mnt      yp:mnt.map

       This will generate two mountpoints for /home and /mnt and install direct mount triggers for
       each entry in the direct mount map auto.data.  All accesses to /home will lead to the  con‐
       sultation  of  the  map in /etc/auto.home and all accesses to /mnt will consult the NIS map
       mnt.map.  All accesses to paths in the map auto.data will trigger mounts when they are  ac‐
       cessed  and  the Name Service Switch configuration will be used to locate the source of the
       map auto.data.
       
       
       For direct maps the mount point is always specified as:

       /-

       and  the key used within the direct map is the full path to the mount point. The direct map
       may have multiple entries in the master map.

       For indirect maps access is by using the path scheme:

       /mount-point/key

       where mount-point is one of the entries listed in the master map. The key is a  single  di‐
       rectory  component  and  is matched against entries in the map given in the entry (See aut‐
       ofs(5)).
       
       The format of a master map entry is:

       mount-point [map-type[,format]:]map [options]

       mount-point
              Base location for the autofs filesystem to be mounted.  For indirect maps  this  di‐
              rectory will be created (as with mkdir -p) and is removed when the autofs filesystem
              is umounted.

       map-type
              Type of map used for this mount point.  The following are valid map types:

              file   The map is a regular text file.

       map
              Name  of  the map to use.  This is an absolute UNIX pathname for maps of types file,
              dir, or program, and the name of a database in the case for maps of  type  yp,  nis‐
              plus, or hesiod or the dn of an LDAP entry for maps of type ldap.

NAME
       autofs - Service control for the automounter

SYNOPSIS
       If a SysV init script system is being used:
       /etc/rc.d/init.d/autofs start|stop|restart|reload|status

       or if the systemd init system is being used:
       systemctl start|stop|restart|reload|status autofs.service


OPERATION
       autofs will consult a configuration file /etc/auto.master (see auto.master(5))  by  default
       to  find mount points on the system. For each of those mount points automount(8) will mount
       and start a thread, with the appropriate parameters, to manage the mount point.
