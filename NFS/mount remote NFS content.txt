MOUNT(8)                               System Administration                              MOUNT(8)

NAME
       mount - mount a filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       mount [-l|-h|-V]

       mount -a [-fFnrsvw] [-t fstype] [-O optlist]

       mount [-fnrsvw] [-o options] device|dir

       mount [-fnrsvw] [-t fstype] [-o options] device dir

       The standard form of the mount command is:

              mount -t type device dir

       This  tells  the kernel to attach the filesystem found on device (which is of type type) at
       the directory dir.  The option -t type is optional.  The mount command is usually  able  to...

Indicating the device and filesystem
       Most  devices  are indicated by a filename (of a block special device), like /dev/sda1, but
       there are other possibilities.  For example, in the case of an NFS mount, device  may  look
       like  knuth.cwi.nl:/dir.  
       

       -t, --types fstype
              The argument following the -t is used to indicate the filesystem type.  The filesys‚Äê
              tem  types  which  are  currently  supported  depend  on  the  running  kernel.  See
              /proc/filesystems and /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/fs for a complete list of  the
              filesystems.   The  most common are ext2, ext3, ext4, xfs, btrfs, vfat, sysfs, proc,
              nfs and cifs.
              
              
Mount nfs shares through fstab

mount option: sync


              It is formatted as a comma-separated list of options.  It contains at least the type
              of  mount (ro or rw), plus any additional options appropriate to the filesystem type
              (including performance-tuning options).  For details, see mount(8) or swapon(8).

              Basic filesystem-independent options are:

              defaults
                     use default options: rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async.
...
mount(8)
       sync   All I/O to the filesystem should be done synchronously.  In the case of media with a
              limited  number  of write cycles (e.g. some flash drives), sync may cause life-cycle
              shortening.
