Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

/bin: binary files of executables such as ls, cp
/dev: binary device file
/etc: core config file
/run: contains process and user-specific info that has been created since the last reboot

/srv: may be used for data by service like NFT, FTP, HTTP

/proc: file system of process and kernel information
/sys: similar to /proc, because of its directroy and file structure. Used as an interface to hardware devices, kernel and associated process.


/home: user directories
/root: home directory for root user

/lib: shell scripts for executables (library)
/lib/modules: loadable kernel modules. These modules can be loaded and unloaded on demand during the course of normal operation.


/sbin: system executables in binary, commands for system management

/tmp: temporary files, shared worksapce of all users

/var: variable directory for log, tracking, caches, mail boxes, spool files etc.

/boot: boot loader files. This directroy contains all files that are needed to boot the linux kernel.

/media, /mnt: mount points for removable media such as flash drive

/opt: thrid party (optional) software

/usr: it's not user files. It is where user-space programs and data resides. The structures looks like the majority of the root directory, and they hold the same type of file. These files are here but not under root directory to keep the space requirments low for the root.

/usr/include: header files
/usr/local: this is where the adminstrator installs their own software
/usr/share: contains file that can work on other kinds of Unix machines

NAME
       hier - description of the filesystem hierarchy

DESCRIPTION
       A typical Linux system has, among others, the following directories:

       /      This is the root directory.  This is where the whole tree starts.

       /boot  Contains static files for the boot loader.  This directory holds only the files which are  needed  during
              the  boot process.  The map installer and configuration files should go to /sbin and /etc.  The operating
              system kernel (initrd for example) must be located in either / or /boot.

       /dev   Special or device files, which refer to physical devices.  See mknod(1).

       /etc   Contains configuration files which are local to the machine.  Some larger software  packages,  like  X11,
              can  have  their  own  subdirectories below /etc.  Site-wide configuration files may be placed here or in
              /usr/etc.  Nevertheless, programs should always look for these files in /etc and you may have  links  for
              these files to /usr/etc.

       /home  On machines with home directories for users, these are usually beneath this directory, directly  or  not.
              The structure of this directory depends on local administration decisions (optional).

       /media This directory contains mount points for removable media such as CD and DVD disks or USB sticks.  On sys‐
              tems  where  more  than  one device exists for mounting a certain type of media, mount directories can be
              created by appending a digit to the name of those available above starting with '0', but the  unqualified
              name must also exist.

       /media/floppy[1-9]
              Floppy drive (optional).

       /media/cdrom[1-9]
              CD-ROM drive (optional).

       /media/cdrecorder[1-9]
              CD writer (optional).

       /media/zip[1-9]
              Zip drive (optional).

       /media/usb[1-9]
              USB drive (optional).

       /mnt   This  directory  is a mount point for a temporarily mounted filesystem.  In some distributions, /mnt con‐
              tains subdirectories intended to be used as mount points for several temporary filesystems.

       /opt   This directory should contain add-on packages that contain static files. ## optional packages

       /proc  This is a mount point for the proc filesystem, which provides information about running processes and the
              kernel.  This pseudo-filesystem is described in more detail in proc(5).

       /root  This directory is usually the home directory for the root user (optional).

       /bin   This  directory contains executable programs which are needed in single user mode and to bring the system
              up or repair it.

       /sbin  Like /bin, this directory holds commands needed to boot the system, but which are usually not executed by
              normal users.

       /srv   This directory contains site-specific data that is served by this system.

# FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard): site-specific data
As it states in documentation:

/srv : Data for services provided by this system

This main purpose of specifying this is so that users may find the location of the data files for particular service, and so that services which require a single tree for readonly data, writable data and scripts (such as cgi scripts) can be reasonably placed. Data that is only of interest to a specific user should go in that users' home directory.

The methodology used to name subdirectories of /srv is unspecified as there is currently no consensus on how this should be done. One method for structuring data under /srv is by protocol, eg. ftp, rsync, www, and cvs. On large systems it can be useful to structure /srv by administrative context, such as /srv/physics/www, /srv/compsci/cvs, etc. This setup will differ from host to host. Therefore, no program should rely on a specific subdirectory structure of /srv existing or data necessarily being stored in /srv. However /srv should always exist on FHS compliant systems and should be used as the default location for such data.


       /sys   This is a mount point for the sysfs filesystem, which provides information about the kernel  like  /proc,
              but better structured, following the formalism of kobject infrastructure.

    # sysfs is a pseudo file system provided by the Linux kernel that exports information about various kernel subsystems, hardware devices, and associated device drivers.
        
       /tmp   This  directory contains temporary files which may be deleted with no notice, such as by a regular job or
              at system boot up.

       /usr   This directory is usually mounted from a separate partition.  It should hold  only  shareable,  read-only
              data, so that it can be mounted by various machines running Linux.  # it contains program files and doc about them
              
       /usr/doc
              Replaced by /usr/share/doc.

       /usr/share/doc
              Documentation about installed programs (optional).

       /usr/bin
              This is the primary directory for executable programs.  Most programs executed by normal users which  are
              not  needed  for booting or for repairing the system and which are not installed locally should be placed
              in this directory.

       /var   This directory contains files which may change in size, such as spool and log files.

# /var/spool contains data which is awaiting some kind of later processing. Data in /var/spool represents work to be done in the future (by a program, user, or administrator); often data is deleted after it has been processed.
