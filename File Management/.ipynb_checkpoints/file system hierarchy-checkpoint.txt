Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

/bin: binary files of executables such as ls, cp
/dev: binary device file
/etc: core config file
/run: contains process and user-specific info that has been created since the last reboot

/srv: may be used for data by service like NFT, FTP, HTTP

/proc: file system of process and kernel information
/sys: similar to /proc, because of its directroy and file structure. Used as an interface to hardware devices, kernel and associated process.


/home: user directories
/root: home directory for root user

/lib: shell scripts for executables (library)
/lib/modules: loadable kernel modules. These modules can be loaded and unloaded on demand during the course of normal operation.


/sbin: system executables in binary, commands for system management

/tmp: temporary files, shared worksapce of all users

/var: variable directory for log, tracking, caches, mail boxes, spool files etc.

/boot: boot loader files. This directroy contains all files that are needed to boot the linux kernel.

/media, /mnt: mount points for removable media such as flash drive

/opt: thrid party (optional) software

/usr: it's not user files. It is where user-space programs and data resides. The structures looks like the majority of the root directory, and they hold the same type of file. These files are here but not under root directory to keep the space requirments low for the root.

/usr/include: header files
/usr/local: this is where the adminstrator installs their own software
/usr/share: contains file that can work on other kinds of Unix machines
