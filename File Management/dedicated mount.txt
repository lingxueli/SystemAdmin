/var: the size of this directory is dynamic. To avoid it filling up all storage on the server, a dedicated device is mounted for this directory.

/home: It's separated so that this could be mounted with specific options, such as noexec, nodev. When reinstalling the OS, the home directory can also survive the system reinstall.

/usr: this contains the program files where user don't need any write access to. Separating it allows administrator to configure it as a read-only mount.
