Configure a web server to use the non-default document root /webfiles. In this
directory, create a file index.html that has the contents hello world and then
test that it works

# install required software: httpd is the base package

# check the common addition package
[root@localhost /]# yum search http

# install httpd
[root@localhost /]# yum install httpd

# this installs httpd along with the commonly used additional packages as well
[root@localhost /]# yum module install httpd


# main Apache configuration file and a few important settings

[root@localhost /]# vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf 
#
# This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/> for detailed information.
# In particular, see 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/directives.html>
# for a discussion of each configuration directive.


#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
#
# Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point
# ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the
# Mutex directive, if file-based mutexes are used.  If you wish to share the
# same ServerRoot for multiple httpd daemons, you will need to change at
# least PidFile.
#
ServerRoot "/etc/httpd"


#
# DocumentRoot: The directory out of which you will serve your
# documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but
# symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.
#
DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"

Update DocumentRoot
[root@localhost /]# vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf 

# DocumentRoot: The directory out of which you will serve your
# documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but
# symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.
#
DocumentRoot "/webfiles"


By default, the Apache web server looks for a file: index.html and will present the contents of that document to clients

[root@localhost /]# vim /var/www/html/index.html
hello world

Move the content file to the claimed directory
[root@localhost /]# mkdir /webfiles && cp /var/www/html/index.html /webfiles/index.html

# start and enable web server

[root@localhost /]# systemctl enable --now httpd
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/httpd.service → /usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service.

[root@localhost /]# systemctl status httpd
